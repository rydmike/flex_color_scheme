/// The [FlexAdaptive] class is used to define on what platforms
/// [FlexColorScheme] generated [ThemeData] platform adaptive theming
/// features are used.
///
/// [FlexColorScheme] provides platform adaptive theming features, where
/// you can opt in and out of theming features and use different settings,
/// based on device platform and platform specific web usage of a web build
/// of your FlexColorScheme themed application.
///
/// The purpose of this feature is to enable using Material design based
/// themes, that are adjusted differently based on the used platform. A typical
/// use case is removing Material-3 design features that may be too opinionated
/// on e.g. iOS and desktop platforms, but you may want to keep them on Android.
///
/// Each platform adaptive theming feature can be configure what platform it
/// applies to. You can even define it so that you get a different theme on the
/// device native build and when using a web build of the same app on same
/// device. The swapping between the default standard theme and the platform
/// adaptive version, can be done per platform and web usage per platform.
///
/// The following adaptive theme settings are available in [FlexColorScheme]:
///
/// - [FlexSubThemesData.adaptiveRemoveElevationTint] to adaptively remove
///   elevation tint when Material-3 mode is used.
/// - [FlexSubThemesData.adaptiveElevationShadowsBack] to adaptively bring
///   elevation shadows back where they were removed in Material-3, when
///   Material-3 mode is used.
/// - [FlexSubThemesData.adaptiveAppBarScrollUnderOff] to adaptively remove the
///   [AppBar] scroll under elevation tint when Material-3 mode is used.
/// - [FlexSubThemesData.adaptiveRadius] to adaptively use global
///   [defaultRadiusAdaptive] instead of [defaultRadius] in both
///   Material-2 and Material-3 mode.
/// - [FlexSubThemesData.adaptiveDialogRadius] to platform adaptively use
///   [dialogRadiusAdaptive] instead of [dialogRadius] in both
///   Material-2 and Material-3 mode as border radius on on dialogs.
/// - [FlexSubThemesData.adaptiveSplashType] to platform adaptively use
///   [splashTypeAdaptive] instead of [splashType] in both
///   Material-2 and Material-3 mode as Ink effect on Material widgets.
///
/// More platform adaptive theming features may be added in future versions,
/// depending on feedback and requests. One planned **future** platform
/// adaptive feature is to introduce the Squircle or super-ellipses
/// as the curvature of the border radius. It would then be possible to use it
/// adaptively on desired platforms. When this adaptive feature is enabled
/// all Material components that use [ShapeBorder] will use Squircle curvature
/// instead of circular borer radius, on selected platforms. The Squircle is
/// the border curvature shape used on Apple devices. Adding this feature
/// is a bit on hold since there is currently no consensus or built-in support
/// in Flutter to draw an iOS correct Squircle. See issue:
/// https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/91523
///
/// - **FUTURE PLAN**: [FlexSubThemesData.adaptiveSquircle] use Squircle as
///   [ShapeBorder] shape instead of Circular, when added, will be available in
///   both Material-2 and Material-3 mode.
///
/// Another planned feature is [FlexSubThemesData.adaptiveAppBarStyle], that
/// can enable you to e.g. use colored AppBar in traditional M2 style, plain
/// white e.g. on iOS. This could be useful for designs that on Android prefer
/// the classic M2 colored AppBar in light mode, but want to use a white AppBar
/// on iOS to match the typical design style on it. Since M3 also brings surface
/// colored AppBar to Android, this adaptive feature may not be in such high
/// demand anymore, but if a feature request for it appears, it may be added.
///
/// By default all adaptive features use the [FlexAdaptive.off] setting and
/// the adaptive style is not used on any platform.
///
/// There are many premade adaptive configurations available. One interesting
/// option is for example the [FlexAdaptive.iOSAndDesktop] configuration. It
/// makes the used adaptive behavior apply to all desktop platforms and their
/// web usage, as well as to iOS devices and their web usage. The purpose of
/// this config is that you only want the opinionated Material 3 designs on
/// Android and Fuchsia devices and when the app is used on web on these
/// devices, this for a platform correct progressive web app design for
/// these devices. But for other usage you want the optional adaptive
/// feature.
///
/// The following pre-made [FlexAdaptive] configuration constructors are
/// available:
///
///  - [FlexAdaptive.off]
///  - [FlexAdaptive.all]
///  - [FlexAdaptive.apple]
///  - [FlexAdaptive.appleWeb]
///  - [FlexAdaptive.desktop]
///  - [FlexAdaptive.iOSAndDesktop]
///  - [FlexAdaptive.excludeAndroidFuchsia]
///  - [FlexAdaptive.excludeWebAndroidFuchsia]
///
/// You can easily make your own custom configuration, if the above ones do
/// not fit your needs.
///
/// Platform aware adaptive theming in [FlexColorScheme] is not a
/// replacement for using actual platform aware and adaptive widgets, either
/// built-in ones in Flutter, or custom/package ones.
///
/// You may want to combine the platform adaptive theming features
/// with selected platform adaptive widgets. The platform adaptive theming can
/// help you remove certain features of Material 3 default theming that may
/// look out of place if you use [MaterialApp] with [ThemeData.useMaterial3]
/// enabled to build a cross platform apps.
///
/// You may often want or need to use some Material Design widgets in your cross
/// platform app. Using the platform aware theming features can make them
/// look more platform agnostic, instead of using their Material 3 defaults.
/// However, on Android you may prefer them to still use their M3 design.
/// The adaptive theming features in [FlexColorScheme] are intended
/// to help you do both with one theme, to achieve such a design goals.
