/// A convenience extension on [ThemeData] to define a
/// [FlexColorScheme] object and return the [ThemeData] object defined by
/// its instance, using its [FlexColorScheme.toTheme] method in one go.
///
/// Provided convenience extensions are:
///
/// * FlexThemeData.light(), based on FlexColorScheme.light().toTheme
/// * FlexThemeData.dark(), based on FlexColorScheme.dark().toTheme
///
/// Using [FlexThemeData.light] is a bit shorter than
/// `FlexColorScheme.light().toTheme`, and it may feel more familiar since
/// you get a [ThemeData] object directly that you can use just like any
/// other ThemeData object produced by Flutter SDK built in ThemeData factory
/// constructors.
///
/// For advanced theming, when constructing elaborate themes where sub themes
/// need access to the [ColorScheme] as defined by your [FlexColorScheme].
/// Consider using [FlexColorScheme], then get the [ColorScheme] it defines
/// with [FlexColorScheme.toScheme] and use
/// colors from this scheme or the entire [ColorScheme] in you sub-themes,
/// that you then apply with [ThemeData.copyWith] to the
/// [ThemeData] given by [FlexColorScheme.toTheme]. You can of course do
/// this with these extensions too, but in that case you will need to store
/// the theme in an intermediate [ThemeData] object.
///
/// It would be nice if it was possible to also provide these as static
/// extensions on ThemeData, in away that would enable a syntax like this:
///
/// * ThemeData.flexLight(), *based on FlexColorScheme.light().toTheme*
/// * ThemeData.flexDark(), *based on FlexColorScheme.dark().toTheme*
///
/// However, Dart does not yet support such extensions, see:
/// https://github.com/dart-lang/language/issues/723

  /// Returns a [ThemeData] object defined by factory [FlexColorScheme.light]
  /// and its [FlexColorScheme.toTheme] method.
