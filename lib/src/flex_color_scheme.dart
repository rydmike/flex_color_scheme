  /// The differences from the standard [ThemeData.from] factory are:
  ///
  ///  * `ScaffoldBackground` has its own color property in `FlexColorScheme`
  ///    and can if so desired differ from the `ColorScheme.background`
  ///    color. In the branding implementation, the `scaffoldBackground`
  ///    typically gets no primary branding applied, only in the heavy choice
  ///    is there a small amount. Whereas `background` in a FlexColorScheme
  ///    receives the most color branding of the surface colors. This fits
  ///    well for where the `background` color is used on Material in Widgets,
  ///    but it does not go so well together with `scaffoldBackground`, which
  ///    is the reason why it has its own color value in this implementation.
  ///
  ///  * The `dialogBackgroundColor` uses the `ColorScheme.surface` color
  ///    instead of the `ColorScheme.background`. The `background` color needed
  ///    the strongest branding when branding is used, but this did not look
  ///    so good on dialogs, so its color choice was changed to `surface`
  ///    instead, that gets lighter branding in FlexColorScheme when it is
  ///    used. With standard Material surface colors the `background` and
  ///    `surface` colors are the same, so there is no difference when using
  ///    the default background and surface colors.
  ///
  ///  * The `indicatorColor` is same as effectiveTabColor which uses a
  ///    function with logic to determine its color bases on if a TabBarTheme
  ///    was selected that should work on current app bar background color,
  ///    or on surface/background colors.
  ///
  ///  * For `toggleableActiveColor` the `ColorScheme.secondary` color is used.

  ///    better. FlexColorScheme's implementation has been changed to use this
  ///    new AppBarTheme feature starting with version 2.0.0-nullsafety.2.
  ///
  ///  * The `AppBarTheme` elevation defaults to 0, an iOs style influenced
  ///    opinionated choice. It can easily be adjusted directly in the
  ///    `FlexColorScheme` definition with property value `appBarElevation`
  ///    without creating a sub theme or using `copyWith`.

  ///    and cannot be null. The `FlexColorScheme` `light` and `dark` factories
  ///    can be null but it will default to 0 if null.
  ///
  ///  * The `bottomAppBarColor` uses color scheme background color to match the
  ///    background color of the drawer, bottom navigation bar, possible side
  ///    menu and system navigation bar on android (if theming of it is used).
  ///    This is a slight change from the ColorScheme default that uses
  ///    surface color.
  ///
  ///  * The `BottomAppBarTheme` elevation defaults to `appBarElevation` or 0 if
  ///    it is null, an iOs style influenced opinionated choice. It can easily
  ///    be adjusted directly in the `FlexColorScheme` definition with property
  ///    value `bottomAppBarElevation` without creating a sub theme or
  ///    using `copyWith`.
  ///
  ///  * A deviation from `ThemeData.from` color scheme based theme's is
  ///    that `ThemeData.accentColor` is set to `ColorScheme.primary` and not to
  ///    `secondary` if not otherwise defined. This is done to get an easy way
  ///    for borders on `TextField.decoration` to use theme based primary
  ///    color in dark-mode, and not `accentColor` color.
  ///
  ///    There may be a bug in the way
  ///    `InputDecorationTheme` gets used by the `InputDecorator`. We were
  ///    unable to define a theme that would work correctly for such a setup
  ///    without resorting to making `accentColor` equal to
  ///    `ThemeData.primaryColor`. This definition has less of an impact
  ///    visually to any built-in widgets than one might suspect. With the all
  ///    the other included theme definitions we saw no other widget that used
  ///    `accentColor`. FAB and toggles have their own theme and colors, so
  ///    they still use the default expected `colorScheme.secondary` color
  ///    despite this change.
  ///
  ///  * The [accentColor] is made available as a separate scheme property.
  ///    Done to enable control of the `OutlineInputBorder()` active border
  ///    color property in color scheme based themes for dark theme-mode.
  ///
  ///  * In `TextSelectionThemeData`, the standard for `selectionColor` is
  ///    `colorScheme.primary` with opacity value `0.4` for dark-mode and `0.12`
  ///    for light mode. Here primary with `0.5` for dark-mode and `0.3` for
  ///    light mode is used. The standard for `selectionHandleColor` is
  ///    `colorScheme.primary`, here we use the slightly darker shade
  ///    `primaryColorDark` instead, which does not have a proper color
  ///    scheme color value in Flutter standard `ColorScheme` based themes.
  ///
  ///  * A predefined slightly opinionated [InputDecorationTheme] is used. It
  ///    sets `filled` to `true` and fill color to color scheme primary color
  ///    with opacity `0.035` in light mode and opacity `0.06` in dark-mode.
  ///    Another theme design change is done via modification of the
  ///    `ThemeData.accentColor` described earlier. Since the used theme, like
  ///    the default theme, does not define a `border` property of `TextField`,
  ///    an app can still easily use both the default underline style, or the
  ///    outline style by just specifying the default `OutlineInputBorder()`
  ///    for the border property when outlined TextField is desired.
  ///    If you don't  want the filled style, or the primary colored
  ///    borders in dark-mode, you can override them back with `copyWith`.
  ///    For totally different border color in dark-mode you can alternatively
  ///    specify it via the `accentColor` property. Which should not affect
  ///    any other color than this border color when using FlexColorScheme
  ///    based themes.
  ///
  ///  * The property `fixTextFieldOutlineLabel` is set to `true` by default,
  ///    it looks better. The only reason why it is not the default in Flutter,
  ///    is for default backwards legacy design compatibility.
  ///
  /// **NOTE:** Since the old buttons have been deprecated in Flutter 2.0.0
  /// they are no longer presented or used in code in FlexColorScheme and its
  /// examples. However, FlexColorScheme still defines the theme for
  /// them described below. Defining the theme does not yet issue any
  /// deprecation warnings or errors, as long as that is the case. this
  /// theming will be kept available to support out of the box nice themes for
  /// the old buttons as before.
  ///
  ///  * Button theming is applied to [ThemeData.buttonColor] using color
  ///    `colorScheme.primary` color.
  ///
  ///  * For [ThemeData.buttonTheme] the entire color scheme is passed to its
  ///    `colorScheme` property and it uses `textTheme` set to
  ///    `ButtonTextTheme.primary`, plus minor changes to padding and tap target
  ///    size. These modifications make the old buttons almost match the
  ///    default design and look of their corresponding newer buttons.
  ///    Thus the `RaisedButton` looks very similar to `ElevatedButton`,
  ///    `OutlineButton` to `OutlinedButton` and `FlatButton` to `TextButton`.
  ///    There are some differences in margins and looks, especially in
  ///    dark-mode, but they are very similar.
  ///
  ///  * The default theme for Chips contain a design bug that makes the

  /// * For [TabBarTheme], the Flutter standard selected tab and indicator
  ///   color is onSurface in dark mode and on Primary in light mode, which is
  ///   designed to fit an AppBar colored TabBar. This is kept, and the default
  ///   via [FlexTabBarStyle.forAppBar] style, with a minor modification. If

  ///   on surface, background and scaffold background colors.
  ///
  ///   The unselected TabBar color when [FlexTabBarStyle.forBackground] style

  ///   is a design used on iOS by default for the bottom navigation bar. We
  ///   agree and think it looks better as the default choice for apps.

  /// * Default tooltip theme in Flutter is currently a bit flawed on desktop
  ///   and web, because it defaults to using a very small font (10 dp).
  ///   See issue: https:///github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/71429
  ///
  ///   The default theming also does not handle multiline tooltips very well.
  ///   The here used [TooltipThemeData] theme design corrects both these
  ///   issues. It uses 12 dp font on desktop and web instead of 10 dp,
  ///   and some padding instead of a height constraint to ensure that
  ///   multiline tooltips look nice too.
  ///
  ///   FlexColorScheme also includes a new boolean property
  ///   [tooltipsMatchBackground], that can be toggled to not used Flutter's
  ///   Material default that has a theme mode
  ///   inverted background. Tooltips using light background in light theme
  ///   and dark in dark, are commonly used on the Windows desktop platform.
  ///   You can tie the extra property to used platform to make an automatic
  ///   platform adaptation of the tooltip style if you like, or give users
  ///   a preference toggle the tooltip style to their liking.
  ///
  /// * The property [transparentStatusBar] is set to true by default and
