/// in dark mode themes. [FlexColorScheme] fixes these gaps and makes it much
/// easier to create themes using the color scheme concept.
///
/// You can create the theme using a standard [ColorScheme], but you can also
/// create a theme by just providing a few selected color values, or
/// no color values at all and get defaults. If you provide both a [ColorScheme]
/// and some individual property values that also exist in a [ColorScheme], the
/// individual property values will override the corresponding ones in your
/// [ColorScheme].
///
/// [FlexColorScheme] does not rely on [ThemeData.from] a [ColorScheme] for
/// its implementation. It uses the [ThemeData] factory directly to create the
/// [ThemeData] object from its [FlexColorScheme] data, that is then returned
/// with the [FlexColorScheme.toTheme] getter.
///
/// A more opinionated theme and style can be returned by passing in a default
/// [FlexSubThemesData] () constructor to [subThemesData].
/// By default the sub-themes take inspiration from the Material 3 (M3) Design
/// guide [specification](https://m3.material.io) and uses its values as
/// defaults when it is possible to do so in Flutter
/// SDK theming, within its current Material 2 (M2) design limitations.
///
/// The component sub-themes can configured further by configuring a large
/// amount of properties in [FlexSubThemesData] that is passed into
/// [FlexColorScheme.subThemesData]. A commonly used feature is
/// to adjust the default corner border radius on all sub-themes for widgets
/// that supports it. The opinionated design is also more flat and features
/// primary tinted hover, focus, highlight and splash colors, among other
/// things.
///
/// It can be verbose to define nice color scheme directly with the default
/// unnamed constructor. [FlexColorScheme] is primarily intended to be used
/// with its two factory constructors [FlexColorScheme.light] and
/// [FlexColorScheme.dark], that create nice schemes using defaults and
/// computed color values. The light and dark schemes also give you access
/// to many predefined color schemes that you can use and easily modify.
///
/// With the light and dark factories you can also create
/// beautiful toned themes from just a single color.
/// [FlexColorScheme] makes it easy to create themes that use color branded
/// surfaces (backgrounds), that use alpha blend to mix in a varying degree
/// of a color, typically the primary color, into surfaces and backgrounds.
///
/// Branded surface are described in the Material design guide, but Flutter
/// offers no out of the box help to make such themes. With [FlexColorScheme]
/// you can use a varying degree of surface and background branding levels for
/// any theme you make, both in light and dark mode.
///
/// [FlexColorScheme] makes it easy to make a theme where the [AppBar]
/// themed background color is not tied to primary color in light theme mode or
/// to surface color in dark theme mode, and it can also follow the branded
/// scheme surface or background color.
///
/// [FlexColorScheme] can automatically adjust the [TabBarTheme] to fit with the
/// active [AppBar] background or to be themed to always fit on
/// background/surface colors, if its primary usage will be in e.g. a [Scaffold]
/// body, or [Material] surface or canvas.
///
/// You can also quickly adjust things like the scrim on the app bar in Android
/// with [transparentStatusBar] and tooltip style with
/// [tooltipsMatchBackground].
///
/// The two factory constructors [FlexColorScheme.light] and

  /// theme colors using the effective [primary], [secondary] and [tertiary]
  /// colors in the factory, as key colors to create tonal palettes for
  /// these main Material 3 color palettes.
  /// Colors from these key color seed generated palettes will then be used as
  /// color tones for the produce [ColorScheme], as defined by the Material 3
  /// design guide. By studying the Flutter SDK [ColorScheme.from] factory you
  /// can see which color tone from what key color is used where.
  /// [FlexColorScheme] uses the same assignments for the tones to the
  /// generated [ColorScheme] when you opt in using Material 3 tonal palettes.
  ///
  /// The [FlexColorScheme] light and dark factory offer more control over the
  /// seed generation setup. With [ColorScheme.from] you can only generate the
  /// [ColorScheme] from one key color, the primary color. With
  /// [FlexColorScheme] factories  you can use separate key colors for
  /// [secondary] and [tertiary] from the [primary] color, to make their
  /// tonal palettes. The effective colors in your [FlexColorScheme] for these
  /// color properties are used as key color inputs when you provide a
  /// [FlexKeyColors] via [keyColors] and enable it by setting
  /// [FlexKeyColors.useKeyColors] to true, which it is in its default
  /// constructor, so to enable it you can just pass in a default
  /// FlexKeyColors() to [keyColors].
  ///
  /// By setting [FlexKeyColors.useSecondary] or
  /// [FlexKeyColors.useTertiary] to false, the corresponding effective colors
  /// in [FlexColorScheme] will not be used as keys for corresponding
  /// [TonalPalette]. If one is off, its tonal palette will instead be based on
  /// the primary color as key. If both are false, the [FlexColorScheme.light]
  /// seeding algorithm becomes the same as using [ColorScheme.from]. The
  /// primary color is always used as seed color when key color seeding is
  /// enabled with [FlexKeyColors.useKeyColors] set to true.
  ///
  /// You can also opt to keep selected effective main colors, primary,
  /// secondary, tertiary and their containers, in your [FlexColorScheme] as
  /// their effective color, even when you enable key color based
  /// seeded tonal palette based ColorScheme output. You do this by
  /// setting [FlexKeyColors.keepPrimary], [FlexKeyColors.keepSecondary] etc to
  /// true, for each color property where you want to keep its exact color value
  /// as defined, but otherwise may be OK with using key seeded color values.
  ///
  /// You can use this feature if you for example want to use an exact
  /// predefined primary brand color in light mode, but are OK with all other
  /// colors using tones derived from its Material 3 tonal palette.
  ///
  /// When you use key color based seeded theme generation, the used key inputs
  /// for primary, secondary and tertiary are only used to set and generate the
  /// tone of the palette used for each colors tonal palette. You will rarely
  /// see the same color on that actual, primary, secondary and tertiary color
  /// in the produced [ColorScheme], unless you lock them down with the "keep"
  /// properties.
  ///
  /// The same tonal palette should typically be used for both
  /// light and dark mode colors. Under the hood [FlexColorScheme] selects the
  /// right color tone from the tonal palette, which is different for light and
  /// dark mode. For a matched light and dark theme, you should use the same
  /// input key color. When you use [FlexColorScheme.light] and
  /// [FlexColorScheme.dark] and the [FlexScheme] enum based [scheme] property,
  /// to use a built-in color scheme, it automatically uses also its
  /// predefined light theme mode defined colors as the key colors for
  /// primary, secondary and tertiary in dark mode, to ensure that the produced
  /// [ColorScheme] is using same tonal palette, but only different tones from
  /// it  for light and dark mode.
  ///
  /// When you use [colors], [colorScheme] or direct override color properties
  /// [primary], [secondary] or [tertiary] in the factories, these effective
  /// colors are used directly as key color inputs. It is then up to
  /// you to decide and design if you use the same key color for tonal palette
  /// generation in light and dark mode.
  ///
  /// If you use [colorScheme] or pass in [primary], [secondary] or
  /// [tertiary], and enable using [keyColors] the generated scheme will first
  /// use color from passed in direct color properties [primary], [secondary]
  /// or [tertiary], as key colors, then the same ones from the passed in
  /// [colorScheme] when it generates the output [ColorScheme] using the active
  /// [FlexKeyColors] setup.
  ///
  /// The generated [ColorScheme]'s properties will override all color
  /// properties that were passed in  via a [colorScheme], except those locked

  ///
  /// The factory has no required [FlexSchemeColor] properties, but typically
  /// a [FlexScheme] enum [scheme] value would be provided to use a pre-defined
  /// color scheme.
  ///
  /// As a second alternative the [FlexSchemeColor] class [colors] property
  /// can be used to define custom scheme colors, that can be created with just
  /// one color property by using the factory [FlexSchemeColor.from].
  ///
  /// As a third option you can provide a complete [ColorScheme] in
  /// [colorScheme] and the custom colors for the theme will be based on that
  /// scheme. Since this is the light theme factory the brightness value in used
  /// [colorScheme] is ignored and resulting effective theme and color scheme
  /// will always be light. Make sure you use colors in your color scheme that
  /// are actually colors for a light theme.
  ///
  /// The factory can produce blended surface colors, and also has other
  /// parameters that may impact the effective color scheme used by final theme,
  /// even when a [colorScheme] are provided. The [FlexColorScheme.toScheme]
  /// will give you the effective color scheme that will also be used
  /// when producing [ThemeData] from [FlexColorScheme] and its factories
  /// with [FlexColorScheme.toTheme].
  ///
  /// The factory contains a large number of other properties that can be used
  /// to create beautiful themes by just adjusting a few behavior properties.
  ///
  /// To activate using opinionated sub themes that further refines the produced
  /// theme, pass in a [FlexSubThemesData] to [subThemesData], and define more
  /// shortcut properties to setup additional features in the sub-themes.
  ///
  /// Material 3 guide introduces a new color system with key colors and tonal
  /// palettes, see
  /// https://m3.material.io/styles/color/the-color-system/key-colors-tones.
  ///
  /// You can opt-in on using this new M3 color system by creating your tonal
  /// theme colors using the effective [primary], [secondary] and [tertiary]
  /// colors in the factory, as key colors to create tonal palettes for
  /// these main Material 3 color palettes.
  /// Colors from these key color seed generated palettes will then be used as
  /// color tones for the produce [ColorScheme], as defined by the Material 3
  /// design guide. By studying the Flutter SDK [ColorScheme.from] factory you
  /// can see which color tone from what key color is used where.
  /// [FlexColorScheme] uses the same assignments for the tones to the
  /// generated [ColorScheme] when you opt in using Material 3 tonal palettes.
  ///
  /// The [FlexColorScheme] light and dark factory offer more control over the
  /// seed generation setup. With [ColorScheme.from] you can only generate the
  /// [ColorScheme] from one key color, the primary color. With
  /// [FlexColorScheme] factories  you can use separate key colors for
  /// [secondary] and [tertiary] from the [primary] color, to make their
  /// tonal palettes. The effective colors in your [FlexColorScheme] for these
  /// color properties are used as key color inputs when you provide a
  /// [FlexKeyColors] via [keyColors] and enable it by setting
  /// [FlexKeyColors.useKeyColors] to true, which it is in its default
  /// constructor, so to enable it you can just pass in a default
  /// FlexKeyColors() to [keyColors].
  ///
  /// By setting [FlexKeyColors.useSecondary] or
  /// [FlexKeyColors.useTertiary] to false, the corresponding effective colors
  /// in [FlexColorScheme] will not be used as keys for corresponding
  /// [TonalPalette]. If one is off, its tonal palette will instead be based on
  /// the primary color as key. If both are false, the [FlexColorScheme.light]
  /// seeding algorithm becomes the same as using [ColorScheme.from]. The
  /// primary color is always used as seed color when key color seeding is
  /// enabled with [FlexKeyColors.useKeyColors] set to true.
  ///
  /// You can also opt to keep selected effective main colors, primary,
  /// secondary, tertiary and their containers, in your [FlexColorScheme] as
  /// their effective color, even when you enable key color based
  /// seeded tonal palette based ColorScheme output. You do this by
  /// setting [FlexKeyColors.keepPrimary], [FlexKeyColors.keepSecondary] etc to
  /// true, for each color property where you want to keep its exact color value
  /// as defined, but otherwise may be OK with using key seeded color values.
  ///
  /// You can use this feature if you for example want to use an exact
  /// predefined primary brand color in light mode, but are OK with all other
  /// colors using tones derived from its Material 3 tonal palette.
  ///
  /// When you use key color based seeded theme generation, the used key inputs
  /// for primary, secondary and tertiary are only used to set and generate the
  /// tone of the palette used for each colors tonal palette. You will rarely
  /// see the same color on that actual, primary, secondary and tertiary color
  /// in the produced [ColorScheme], unless you lock them down with the "keep"
  /// properties.
  ///
  /// The same tonal palette should typically be used for both
  /// light and dark mode colors. Under the hood [FlexColorScheme] selects the
  /// right color tone from the tonal palette, which is different for light and
  /// dark mode. For a matched light and dark theme, you should use the same
  /// input key color. When you use [FlexColorScheme.light] and
  /// [FlexColorScheme.dark] and the [FlexScheme] enum based [scheme] property,
  /// to use a built-in color scheme, it automatically uses also its
  /// predefined light theme mode defined colors as the key colors for
  /// primary, secondary and tertiary in dark mode, to ensure that the produced
  /// [ColorScheme] is using same tonal palette, but only different tones from
  /// it  for light and dark mode.
  ///
  /// When you use [colors], [colorScheme] or direct override color properties
  /// [primary], [secondary] or [tertiary] in the factories, these effective
  /// colors are used directly as key color inputs. It is then up to
  /// you to decide and design if you use the same key color for tonal palette
  /// generation in light and dark mode.
  ///
  /// If you use [colorScheme] or pass in [primary], [secondary] or
  /// [tertiary], and enable using [keyColors] the generated scheme will first
  /// use color from passed in direct color properties [primary], [secondary]
  /// or [tertiary], as key colors, then the same ones from the passed in
  /// [colorScheme] when it generates the output [ColorScheme] using the active
  /// [FlexKeyColors] setup.
  ///
  /// The generated [ColorScheme]'s properties will override all color
  /// properties that were passed in  via a [colorScheme], except those locked
  /// via the `keep` properties in [FlexKeyColors].
  ///
  /// If you assign override colors via direct color properties for the main
  /// colors [primary], [secondary] or [tertiary] and their containers, they
  /// will also only override the generated resulting [ColorScheme] if the
  /// the `keep` properties are set in [FlexKeyColors]. Other color properties
  /// that exist as both direct color properties and as a color in the
  /// generated resulting [ColorScheme], will always override the generated
  /// color property if they are assigned.
  ///
  /// Normally if you provide an entire [colorScheme] to [FlexColorScheme] it
  /// is typically because you already have a scheme that you want to use as is,
  /// then don't enable [keyColors] or any blends. It is however possible to
  /// apply both blends to passed in [colorScheme] surfaces or to just use
  /// the [primary], [secondary] or [tertiary] colors in passed in [colorScheme]

  /// In standard Flutter themes, the surface, background, scaffoldBackground
  /// and in light theme, even system are all the same color. For such themes
  /// this convenience property does not make so much sense. However, if you use
  /// FlexColorScheme and its primary color surface branding, these colors are
  /// not the same. This then offers a convenient way to switch the

  /// your theme's surface branded background color and to choose which one
  /// to use.

  /// avoid the system scrim on Android version where it is supported. This
  /// is done because the selected background color is the scrim itself when
  /// used with the opacity parameter and we never want an extra scrim. If we
  /// set opacity very low and loose contrast due to that, it is because it is
  /// our intent.

  /// [systemNavigationBarDividerColor]. The call to set and use the divider
  /// color is only made once a none null or true value has been given to
  /// [useDivider].

  /// the divider color, and calling it with null again will not remove it.
  ///
  /// Be aware that once you have enabled the divider by setting it to true that
  /// there is no convenient way to get rid of it. You can set the value

  /// nav bar background color to make it invisible, it is still there, but

  ///    can be null but it will default to 0 if null.
  ///
  ///  * The `bottomAppBarColor` uses color scheme background color to match the
  ///    background color of the drawer, bottom navigation bar, possible side
  ///    menu and system navigation bar on android (if theming of it is used).
  ///    This is a slight change from the ColorScheme default that uses
  ///    surface color.

  ///    it is null. It can easily be adjusted directly in the
  ///    `FlexColorScheme` definition with property

  ///    using `copyWith`.
  ///
  ///  * In `TextSelectionThemeData`, the standard for `selectionColor` is
  ///    `colorScheme.primary` with opacity value `0.4` for dark-mode and `0.12`
  ///    for light mode. Here primary with `0.5` for dark-mode and `0.3` for
  ///    light mode is used. The standard for `selectionHandleColor` is
  ///    `colorScheme.primary`, here we use the slightly darker shade
  ///    `primaryColorDark` instead, which does not have a proper color
  ///    scheme color value in Flutter standard `ColorScheme` based themes.
  ///
  ///  * A predefined slightly opinionated [InputDecorationTheme] is used. It
  ///    sets `filled` to `true` and fill color to color scheme primary color
  ///    with opacity `0.035` in light mode and opacity `0.06` in dark-mode.
  ///
  ///  * The property `fixTextFieldOutlineLabel` is set to `true` by default,
  ///    it looks better. The only reason why it is not the default in Flutter,
  ///    is for default backwards legacy design compatibility.
  ///
  ///  * For [ThemeData.buttonTheme] the entire color scheme is passed to its
  ///    `colorScheme` property and it uses `textTheme` set to
  ///    `ButtonTextTheme.primary`, plus minor changes to padding and tap target
  ///    size. These modifications make the old buttons almost match the
  ///    default design and look of their corresponding newer buttons.
  ///    Thus the `RaisedButton` looks very similar to `ElevatedButton`,
  ///    `OutlineButton` to `OutlinedButton` and `FlatButton` to `TextButton`.
  ///    There are some differences in margins and looks, especially in
  ///    dark-mode, but they are very similar.
  ///
  ///  * The default theme for Chips contain a design bug that makes the
  ///    selected `ChoiceChip()` widget look disabled in dark-mode, regardless
  ///    if was created with `ThemeData` or `ThemeData.from` factory.
  ///    See issue: https:///github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/65663
  ///    The [ChipThemeData] modification used here fixes the issue.
  ///
  /// * For [TabBarTheme], the Flutter standard selected tab and indicator
  ///   color is onSurface in dark mode and on Primary in light mode, which is
  ///   designed to fit an AppBar colored TabBar. This is kept, and the default

  ///   If the [FlexTabBarStyle.forBackground] style was used, the

  ///   on surface, background and scaffold background colors.
  ///
  ///   The unselected TabBar color when [FlexTabBarStyle.forBackground] style
  ///   is used, is always the onSurface color with 60% opacity. This is also
  ///   the color if the AppBar background color brightness is light AND its
  ///   color is white, surface or background colored.
  ///   Otherwise when the style [FlexTabBarStyle.forAppBar] is used, the
  ///   unselected tab bar color is the selected tab color with 70% opacity.

  /// * The [BottomNavigationBarThemeData] uses color scheme primary color for
  ///   the selected item in both light and dark theme. Flutter SDK defaults

  /// * Default tooltip theme in Flutter is currently a bit flawed on desktop
  ///   and web, because it defaults to using a very small font (10 dp).
  ///   See issue: https:///github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/71429
  ///
  ///   The default theming also does not handle multiline tooltips very well.
  ///   The here used [TooltipThemeData] theme design corrects both these
  ///   issues. It uses 12 dp font on desktop and web instead of 10 dp,
  ///   and some padding instead of a height constraint to ensure that
  ///   multiline tooltips look nice too.
  ///
  ///   FlexColorScheme also includes a new boolean property
  ///   [tooltipsMatchBackground], that can be toggled to not used Flutter's
  ///   Material default that has a theme mode
  ///   inverted background. Tooltips using light background in light theme
  ///   and dark in dark, are commonly used on the Windows desktop platform.
  ///   You can tie the extra property to used platform to make an automatic
  ///   platform adaptation of the tooltip style if you like, or give users
  ///   a preference toggle the tooltip style to their liking.
  ///
  /// * The property [transparentStatusBar] is set to true by default and
  ///   used to make to the AppBar one-toned on Android device like on iOS.
  ///   Set it to `false` to restore default Android design.
  ///
  ///   > It would be nice if we could also make the system navigation button

  /// [FlexColorScheme], including the surface and
  /// background color branding, and e.g. true black for dark mode, if those
  /// were used in its creation via the light and dark factories. The big

  /// from this scheme will not include any of the theme improvements included
  /// in the [FlexColorScheme.toTheme] method. The AppBar theme options

  /// will be equal to background, which might not be the design you intended.
