/// [FlexColorScheme] makes it easier to make a theme where the [AppBar]

  ///
  ///  * Background color for `AppBarTheme` can use a custom color theme
  ///    in both light and dark themes, that is not dependent on theme
  ///    primary or surface color.
  ///    In the versions prior to Flutter 2.0.0 doing this was difficult to do.
  ///    As presented in https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/50606
  ///    A new feature in Flutter 2.0.0 implemented via:
  ///    https://github.com/flutter/flutter/pull/71184 makes this easy and
  ///    better. FlexColorScheme's implementation has been changed to use this
  ///    new AppBarTheme feature starting with version 2.0.0-nullsafety.2.
  ///
  ///  * The `AppBarTheme` elevation defaults to 0, an iOs style influenced
  ///    opinionated choice. It can easily be adjusted directly in the
  ///    `FlexColorScheme` definition with property value `appBarElevation`
  ///    without creating a sub theme or using `copyWith`.
  ///    For the main less used constructor of `FlexColorScheme` it is required
  ///    and cannot be null. The `FlexColorScheme` `light` and `dark` factories
  ///    can be null but it will default to 0 if null.
  ///
  ///  * The `bottomAppBarColor` uses color scheme background color to match the
  ///    background color of the drawer, bottom navigation bar, possible side
  ///    menu and system navigation bar on android (if theming of it is used).
  ///    This is a slight change from the ColorScheme default that uses
  ///    surface color.
  ///
  ///  * The `BottomAppBarTheme` elevation defaults to `appBarElevation` or 0 if
  ///    it is null, an iOs style influenced opinionated choice. It can easily
  ///    be adjusted directly in the `FlexColorScheme` definition with property
  ///    value `bottomAppBarElevation` without creating a sub theme or
  ///    using `copyWith`.
  ///
  ///  * In `TextSelectionThemeData`, the standard for `selectionColor` is
  ///    `colorScheme.primary` with opacity value `0.4` for dark-mode and `0.12`
  ///    for light mode. Here primary with `0.5` for dark-mode and `0.3` for
  ///    light mode is used. The standard for `selectionHandleColor` is
  ///    `colorScheme.primary`, here we use the slightly darker shade
  ///    `primaryColorDark` instead, which does not have a proper color
  ///    scheme color value in Flutter standard `ColorScheme` based themes.
  ///
  ///  * A predefined slightly opinionated [InputDecorationTheme] is used. It
  ///    sets `filled` to `true` and fill color to color scheme primary color
  ///    with opacity `0.035` in light mode and opacity `0.06` in dark-mode.
  ///
  ///  * The property `fixTextFieldOutlineLabel` is set to `true` by default,
  ///    it looks better. The only reason why it is not the default in Flutter,
  ///    is for default backwards legacy design compatibility.
  ///
  ///  * For [ThemeData.buttonTheme] the entire color scheme is passed to its
  ///    `colorScheme` property and it uses `textTheme` set to
  ///    `ButtonTextTheme.primary`, plus minor changes to padding and tap target
  ///    size. These modifications make the old buttons almost match the
  ///    default design and look of their corresponding newer buttons.
  ///    Thus the `RaisedButton` looks very similar to `ElevatedButton`,
  ///    `OutlineButton` to `OutlinedButton` and `FlatButton` to `TextButton`.
  ///    There are some differences in margins and looks, especially in
  ///    dark-mode, but they are very similar.
  ///
  ///  * The default theme for Chips contain a design bug that makes the
  ///    selected `ChoiceChip()` widget look disabled in dark-mode, regardless
  ///    if was created with `ThemeData` or `ThemeData.from` factory.
  ///    See issue: https:///github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/65663
  ///    The [ChipThemeData] modification used here fixes the issue.
  ///
  /// * For [TabBarTheme], the Flutter standard selected tab and indicator
  ///   color is onSurface in dark mode and on Primary in light mode, which is
  ///   designed to fit an AppBar colored TabBar. This is kept, and the default
  ///   via [FlexTabBarStyle.forAppBar] style, with a minor modification. If
  ///   AppBar is "light", then black87 is used, not black, it is the same as
  ///   the textTheme on AppBar in light app bar brightness.
  ///   If the [FlexTabBarStyle.forBackground] style was used, the
  ///   selected  color is always color scheme primary color, which works well
  ///   on surface, background and scaffold background colors.
  ///
  ///   The unselected TabBar color when [FlexTabBarStyle.forBackground] style
  ///   is used, is always the onSurface color with 60% opacity. This is also
  ///   the color if the AppBar background color brightness is light AND its
  ///   color is white, surface or background colored.
  ///   Otherwise when the style [FlexTabBarStyle.forAppBar] is used, the
  ///   unselected tab bar color is the selected tab color with 70% opacity.
  ///   This opacity value is the same  as Flutter default for the default
  ///   theme that is also designed for AppBar usage.
  ///
  /// * The [BottomNavigationBarThemeData] uses color scheme primary color for
  ///   the selected item in both light and dark theme. Flutter SDK defaults
  ///   to secondary color in dark mode. Using only primary color
  ///   is a design used on iOS by default for the bottom navigation bar. We
  ///   agree and think it looks better as the default choice for apps also
  ///   in dark mode.
  ///
  /// * Default tooltip theme in Flutter is currently a bit flawed on desktop
  ///   and web, because it defaults to using a very small font (10 dp).
  ///   See issue: https:///github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/71429
  ///
  ///   The default theming also does not handle multiline tooltips very well.
  ///   The here used [TooltipThemeData] theme design corrects both these
  ///   issues. It uses 12 dp font on desktop and web instead of 10 dp,
  ///   and some padding instead of a height constraint to ensure that
  ///   multiline tooltips look nice too.
  ///
  ///   FlexColorScheme also includes a new boolean property
  ///   [tooltipsMatchBackground], that can be toggled to not used Flutter's
  ///   Material default that has a theme mode
  ///   inverted background. Tooltips using light background in light theme
  ///   and dark in dark, are commonly used on the Windows desktop platform.
  ///   You can tie the extra property to used platform to make an automatic
  ///   platform adaptation of the tooltip style if you like, or give users
  ///   a preference toggle the tooltip style to their liking.
  ///
  /// * The property [transparentStatusBar] is set to true by default and
  ///   used to make to the AppBar one-toned on Android device like on iOS.
  ///   Set it to `false` to restore default Android design.
  ///
  ///   > It would be nice if we could also make the system navigation button
  ///   > area on Android transparent via a theme, but it does not work.
  ///   > The style is doable, but requires modifying Android config files, not
  ///   > possible from Flutter only (as per current information).
