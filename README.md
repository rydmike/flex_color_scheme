# FlexColorScheme

**FlexColorScheme** helps you make beautiful color scheme based Flutter themes, with optional primary
color branding on surfaces. The created themes are based on the same concept as Flutter's ColorScheme based themes,
but with a few interesting twists and convenience features.

For some additional information about **FlexColorScheme**, its background and use cases, the package companion
[**blog post and article**](https://rydmike.com/colorscheme) is also recommended reading.

## Introduction

When you design Flutter applications you should base the colors of your application on a light theme mode
ColorScheme and a dark theme mode ColorScheme. Then make your light and dark ThemeData from these color schemes, and in
your MaterialApp use these themes for the light and dark themes. This gives you an application that uses the defined
color scheme on the built-in Material UI Widgets, well on most of them anyway. Flutter's `ThemeData.from` a
`ColorScheme` has a few gaps, the used color scheme is not consistently applied to **all** standard Material UI Widgets.

FlexColorScheme corrects these minor inconsistencies and gaps that exist in the current version of Flutter's
`ThemeData.from` factory. It also makes a few opinionated, but subtle theme modifications compared to the
`ThemeData.from` themes created from a `ColorScheme`. These topics are covered in detail in the
[last chapter](#behind-the-scenes) and in the article you can find a
[visual presentation](https://rydmike.com/colorscheme#the-difference) of the differences.

FlexColorScheme can also do some other nice theme design tricks.
If you have seen the Flutter [**Flexfold web demo**](https://rydmike.com/demoflexfold) application, then you
have already seen **FlexColorScheme** in action. The Flexfold demo app uses this package for its fancy theming and to
enable effortless switching between all the themes it uses. The package included examples in the
[tutorial chapter](#tutorial), show you how the Flexfold demo app theming is done with this package.

### Color Branded Backgrounds and Surfaces

The Material Guide briefly mentions
[color branded surfaces](https://material.io/design/color/dark-theme.html#properties). With **FlexColorScheme** you
can easily create such primary color branded themes. This is done by using the four built-in strengths for blending in
primary color into surface and background colors, while avoiding blending it in with the scaffold background color,
for all but the highest strength. It is quite interesting what a bit of extra flair and purposefully designed feeling it
can result in when used appropriately.

### Nuanced Scheme Set from One Color

A `FlexColorScheme` can like Flutter's standard `ColorScheme` be created by specifying all the required
scheme colors. You can also specify just the primary color, and get all other colors needed for a complete color
scheme computed based on only the provided primary color.

There is a helper class with a factory `FlexSchemeColor.from` that can do this for you. Another helper can
create a computed matching dark scheme from a defined light scheme, this is done with `FlexSchemeColor.toDark`.
This works regardless of if you created a fully specified custom light scheme, or one from just a single color.
These features are presented and explained in tutorial
[example 4](#example-4---switch-between-built-in-color-schemes-and-custom-ones) and
[example 5](#example-5---full-featured-demo).

### What About My Own Theme Additions?

FlexColorScheme does not get in the way of adding your own additional custom theming to your application.
When you have defined your `FlexColorScheme`, you make a theme based on its scheme with `FlexColorScheme.toTheme`,
that returns a `ThemeData` object that you can use like any other `ThemeData` object. You can then of course
override this returned theme data and add additional custom sub-theming to it with the normal
ThemeData `copyWith` method before passing it on to your application's `theme` or `darkTheme` property.

### Built-in Color Schemes

Color schemes are no fun without some built-in example schemes to use and play with.
**FlexColorScheme** comes with **28** ready to go matching light and dark schemes, that you can use in your
applications if you like. Here is a composite image showing them all.

<img src="https://github.com/rydmike/flex_color_scheme/blob/master/resources/fcs_all_schemes_28_at_100.png?raw=true" alt="ColorScheme all"/>

The above image is just an overview of all the color schemes. In the package companion blog post you can
find [**high resolution images**](https://rydmike.com/colorscheme#built-in-color-schemes) of each one of them.
Another convenient and recommended way to see and try all the predefined color schemes is by using the live Web
versions of the package [example 4](https://rydmike.com/flexcolorscheme4) or 
[example 5](https://rydmike.com/flexcolorscheme4), where you can try all the built-in color schemes and see 
the impact they have on often used Flutter widgets. In [**Appendix A**](#appendix-a---built-in-scheme-reference) you
can find a table listing all the built-in schemes, their `FlexScheme` enum value, name and description, plus 
thumbnails of each color scheme with a link its high-resolution images.

The built-in color schemes are all tuned matching light and dark scheme pairs. Most of them are pretty conservative,
but some are intentionally a bit more playful and bold. The first two color schemes are actually
the Flutter and Material Design Guide examples of light and dark color schemes, and the Flutter high contrast light and
dark color versions as well. So OK, there are actually "only" 26 new ready-made light and dark color scheme pairs.

#### This ColorScheme Should be Different!

The built-in schemes in no way claim to be a "this selection" fits all needs collection, nor do they claim to be 
more correct than any other color scheme. What fits your needs and looks good to you, is of course the right choice
for your application and use case. You can easily make your own custom scheme totally from scratch or copy colors
from an existing scheme, or change the colors that do not fit your design requirements.

#### Design Your Custom Schemes for FlexColorScheme

The package examples show how you can easily make and use your own custom schemes for FlexColorScheme. Maybe 
the built-in examples will inspire your creative side to define your own schemes. The tutorial walks you through how
to define your own color schemes and make themes based on them instead.

You can even create your own custom list or map of schemes and use all of them, instead of the built-in ones. 
The built-in schemes implementation can then function as one possible implementation guide on how to do this.

While building, testing and using this package over a period of time, a number of color schemes were born as a 
side product. I decided to include them in FlexColorscheme and offer them for re-use and inspiration as they are, 
but in no way is it a necessity to use them to reap the benefits of FlexColorScheme.

The color and scheme definitions for the built-in color schemes are in their own classes and will not be included 
in the release compiled version of your application if you do not use (reference) them in your application, and instead 
only use your own custom scheme colors.

#### If I don't Use the Predefined Schemes, Why Should I Use FlexColorScheme?

The main purpose for creating this package was to be able to easily switch among multiple color schemes in an app,
to address some gaps in Flutter's default color scheme based themes, to provide an
easy way to make theme's with primary color branded backgrounds and surfaces, vary this branding strength
and to provide an easy toggle for different app bar designs, without the need to make a custom theme for it 
manually every time. FlexColorScheme also adds support for a **true black** mode for dark themes.

Additionally, FlexColorScheme introduces a way to make "lazy" quick toned ColorScheme based themes from just a single
light scheme color, even its dark scheme counterpart can be made from this single color definition. To understand how
this can be done, it is recommended to go through the tutorial in this readme file.

If you like and need the above features, then FlexColorScheme may fit your theming requirements even if you do not
use any of its built-in color schemes. There is no need to use any of the built-in color schemes to 
benefit from FlexColorScheme's capabilities.

#### Can We Change this Predefined Scheme's Colors?

No, current predefined schemes will not be changed. Changing them would be a breaking change to the package
version promise. Sure, the scheme colors could in theory be changed by releasing a new major version 
that break past scheme color definitions. At the moment, there are no plans to ever add breaking releases to just 
change a predefined scheme's color(s). All current color definition values are also included in the package tests, and
a failed color value test is considered a breaking change.

#### Can We Add This Scheme?

I do plan to from time to time add new color schemes to the built-in ones, just to keep things interesting and if
I happen to come up with one that I like and want to add.

If you have a lovely ColorScheme set with matching light and dark theme mode colors, that you think really
should be included in FlexColorScheme's built-in schemes collection, then by all means please feel free post a 
suggestion as a GitHub issue. No promises are made about its eventual inclusion, but if I also think it is a really 
nice and pretty color scheme, it might very well get included. Coming up with nice schemes is trickier than it 
seems, so contributions to new ones will be considered.

## Installing and Using

In the `pubspec.yaml` of your **Flutter** project, add the following dependency:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flex_color_scheme: any
```

In your library file add the following import:

```dart
import 'package:flex_color_scheme/flex_color_scheme.dart';
```

You can now start using `FlexColorScheme` based themes in your application. The easiest way to do so is to use one
of the 28 built-in color schemes. The schemes have enums that you can use to refer to them. Their corresponding
data object holds name, description and separate scheme data for each schemes' light and dark mode.

As a simple use case, take the **default Flutter counter app**, do the above installation and select one of the
built-in FlexColorScheme's schemes to use with it.

In this example we use **"Oh Mandy red"** scheme that is represented by enum value `FlexScheme.mandyRed`.

We also set the app's `themeMode` property to `ThemeMode.system` so that the used device can control if the app
uses its light or dark theme, based on the device system setting for light and dark theme.

Totally just one property modified, and two properties added to the default counter app, plus the package
import of course. The modified MaterialApp from the Flutter default counter app is shown below.

```dart
  class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
    @override
    Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Flutter Demo',
      // The Mandy red, light theme.
      theme: FlexColorScheme.light(scheme: FlexScheme.mandyRed).toTheme,
      // The Mandy red, dark theme.
      darkTheme: FlexColorScheme.dark(scheme: FlexScheme.mandyRed).toTheme,
      // Use dark or light theme based on system setting.
      themeMode: ThemeMode.system,
      home: MyHomePage(title: 'Flutter Demo Home Page'),
    );
```

The above additions gives us the following counter app look:

<img src="https://github.com/rydmike/flex_color_scheme/blob/master/resources/fcs_counter_app.png?raw=true" alt="counter sample"/>

Perhaps not so exciting, that is because the basic counter app uses very few features and widgets, so it cannot really
illustrate the result very well. This is why the included examples contain demo UI, that is not really at all relevant
to using FlexColorScheme and is really only there to better demonstrate the result.


> **NOTE:**  
> Version 1.4.0 introduced the easier and less verbose `scheme` convenience factory property used above.
> You can use it instead of `colors` if all you want to do is just use one of the built-in color schemes.
> The previous way of
> using `colors` with the `FlexColor.schemes` **map**, with the `FlexScheme` enum values as keys, works as before
> too, but is not needed for this simple use case. The `colors` property is still used in the examples for custom
> color schemes and mixing custom schemes with selected built-in ones.
>
> For reference and comparison, with the `color` factory property, using a built-in color scheme looks like this:
>
> ```dart
> theme: FlexColorScheme.light(
>     colors: FlexColor.schemes[FlexScheme.mandyRed].light,
>  ).toTheme,
> ```
> with the `scheme` convenience property this can instead be written like this:
>
> ```dart
> theme: FlexColorScheme.light(scheme: FlexScheme.mandyRed).toTheme,
> ```
> Which is a much nicer way to access and use a predefined color scheme.
>
> The `FlexColorScheme.light`and `FlexColorScheme.dark` factories no longer require any of their properties.
> If both `scheme` and `colors` properties are defined, then `colors` takes precedence. If both are
> undefined (null), then `scheme` defaults to `FlexScheme.material`, which defines the color scheme used in the
> [Material Design Guide](https://material.io/design/color/the-color-system.html#color-theme-creation). This addition
> does not change any possible past behavior.

#### Can I use different built-in color schemes for my light and dark themes?
Yes this is possible, just use different `FlexScheme` enums values for the light and dark FlexColorScheme factories
`scheme` property. If the colors used by the selected schemes are a bit related, this
can be used to create nice and unique light and dark combinations of the predefined schemes.

By using the `colors` property you could even apply a `FlexSchemeColor` that has data that was designed for a light 
theme to the FlexColorScheme.dark factory and wise versa. For example, with the 
`FlexColorScheme.dark` factory, you could to its `colors` property assign the `FlexSchemeColors` from  
`FlexColor.schemes[FlexScheme.mandyRed].light` that are designed and intended to be used with the light mode factory.
The results will typically just not be as useful or pretty.
The rationale for the slightly involved structure, is to keep it flexible, but at the same time provide self
documenting API guidance on how the data was designed to be used and consumed. The new `scheme` property 
prevents using the light scheme colors for the dark factory and wise versa. It can however still be done if so desired
with the `colors` property as shown above. The `colors` property is always needed and used when you make 
custom color schemes with the `FlexColorScheme.light` and `FlexColorScheme.dark` factories.

### Default Sample Application

The package contains five different example applications with increasing complexity.

The default example 1, is just a repeat of the above example, but with a `themeMode` 3-way toggle
switch, an effective theme colors widget, plus a bunch of dummy commonly used Material UI widgets.

To try the simplest and default **example 1** on a device or simulator,
clone the [repository](https://github.com/rydmike/flex_color_scheme) and run the example:

```bash
cd example/
flutter run --release
```

The result is a sample app that uses the built-in "Oh Mandy red" color scheme as its theme. Has a
light/dark/system theme mode switch, includes a theme colors presentation widget and Material UI widget samples.
With them you can see the active theme's colors, and the created theme's impact on common Material UI widgets.

The default sample app, example 1, shows the simplest use-case of FlexColorScheme and barely scratches the 
surface of what it can do. To get the full details in a step by step progression,  go through the tutorial 
that uses examples 1 through 5, to introduce more features in a step by step complexity progression.

> **Building the examples**
>If you cloned the repository to build the examples, you can open the package `/example` folder with your IDE to build
>the above default example. This example is the same as the example in the `/example/lib/example1` folder.
>If you want to build the other examples, without setting up different configurations in your IDE for the different
>main files, you can copy and paste the wanted example's `main.dart` code into the `/example/lib/main.dart` file to
> build it from your IDE. After copying the new main example content, change the relative
> import for the "all shared imports" file to:
>`import 'all_shared_imports.dart';`
>and for examples 4 and 5, also the "sub page" import to:
>`import 'shared/sub_page.dart';`

### Live WEB Demos of the Examples

If you want to take a quick look at all the examples, you can try live web versions of them.

[**Example 1**](https://rydmike.com/flexcolorscheme1) represents the simplest use case, to just use one of the
built-in color schemes as your application theme and toggle between its light
and dark variant, or allow device mode setting to control if the dark or light theme is used.

<img src="https://github.com/rydmike/flex_color_scheme/blob/master/resources/fcs_phone_ex1al.png?raw=true" alt="ColorScheme example 1 light" width="120"/><img src="https://github.com/rydmike/flex_color_scheme/blob/master/resources/fcs_phone_ex1ad.png?raw=true" alt="ColorScheme example 1 dark" width="120"/>

[**Example 2**](https://rydmike.com/flexcolorscheme2) is like example 1, but here we use custom colors
to make a custom scheme and turn it into a theme.

<img src="https://github.com/rydmike/flex_color_scheme/blob/master/resources/fcs_phone_ex2al.png?raw=true" alt="ColorScheme example 2 light" width="120"/><img src="https://github.com/rydmike/flex_color_scheme/blob/master/resources/fcs_phone_ex2ad.png?raw=true" alt="ColorScheme example 2 dark" width="120"/>

[**In example 3**](https://rydmike.com/flexcolorscheme3) we can toggle the active theme between 3 different
predefined color schemes, plus the custom one we made in example 2.

<img src="https://github.com/rydmike/flex_color_scheme/blob/master/resources/fcs_phone_ex3al.png?raw=true" alt="ColorScheme example 3a light" width="120"/><img src="https://github.com/rydmike/flex_color_scheme/blob/master/resources/fcs_phone_ex3ad.png?raw=true" alt="ColorScheme example 3a dark" width="120"/><img src="https://github.com/rydmike/flex_color_scheme/blob/master/resources/fcs_phone_ex3bl.png?raw=true" alt="ColorScheme example 3b light" width="120"/><img src="https://github.com/rydmike/flex_color_scheme/blob/master/resources/fcs_phone_ex3bd.png?raw=true" alt="ColorScheme example 3b dark" width="120"/>

[**In example 4**](https://rydmike.com/flexcolorscheme4) we can select any of the different built-in themes
and three custom ones we made.

<img src="https://github.com/rydmike/flex_color_scheme/blob/master/resources/fcs_phone_ex4al.png?raw=true" alt="ColorScheme example 4a light" width="120"/><img src="https://github.com/rydmike/flex_color_scheme/blob/master/resources/fcs_phone_ex4bl.png?raw=true" alt="ColorScheme example 4b light" width="120"/><img src="https://github.com/rydmike/flex_color_scheme/blob/master/resources/fcs_phone_ex4cl.png?raw=true" alt="ColorScheme example 4c light" width="120"/><img src="https://github.com/rydmike/flex_color_scheme/blob/master/resources/fcs_phone_ex4cd.png?raw=true" alt="ColorScheme example 4c dark" width="120"/>

[**Example 5**](https://rydmike.com/flexcolorscheme5) is the last, and most complex one of the examples and presents
more configuration options that you can modify interactively.
This example is best seen and tested on a tablet, desktop or desktop web browser, rather than on a phone, but it
certainly works on a phone sized canvas too. This example is explained in more detail further below.

<img src="https://github.com/rydmike/flex_color_scheme/blob/master/resources/fcs_phone_ex5al.png?raw=true" alt="ColorScheme example 5 light" width="120"/><img src="https://github.com/rydmike/flex_color_scheme/blob/master/resources/fcs_phone_ex5bl.png?raw=true" alt="ColorScheme example 5b light" width="120"/><img src="https://github.com/rydmike/flex_color_scheme/blob/master/resources/fcs_phone_ex5fl.png?raw=true" alt="ColorScheme example 5f light" width="120"/><img src="https://github.com/rydmike/flex_color_scheme/blob/master/resources/fcs_phone_ex5gl.png?raw=true" alt="ColorScheme example 5g light" width="120"/>

[**Flexfold demo**](https://rydmike.com/demoflexfold)

A really fancy example of **FlexColorScheme** usage is the [**Flexfold demo app**](https://rydmike.com/demoflexfold).

<img src="https://github.com/rydmike/flex_color_scheme/blob/master/resources/FoldTheme1.gif?raw=true" alt="FlexColorScheme" width="650"/>

It might look and feel complicated, but it is actually only slightly more involved than the above example nr 5, that
has almost all the same theming features, and the same themes as the Flexfold demo app.
Go through the examples, and you will be ready to make cool interactively custom themed apps like this in no time.

## Tutorial

In this tutorial we go through all the bundled examples and explain the used `FlexColorScheme` features in each example.
For simplicity the example applications do not use any advanced state management solution. The key part for each
example is always in the used stateful `MaterialApp`, where all the scheme setup for the themes are made. The rest of
the content in the examples is just there to make a visual presentation of the resulting theme from the used
color scheme.

### Used HomePage in the Examples

The content of the `HomePage` in all these examples is not relevant for using `FlexColorScheme` based
application theming. The critical parts are in the example `MaterialApp` theme definitions. The `HomePage` just
contains UI to visually show what the resulting themes look like, when used in an application with often used Flutter
Widgets. In example 5 we can also make interactive changes to many `FlexColorScheme` API values to
see and learn how they work in practice.

In all the examples we pass in the `FlexSchemeData` object we used for the active theme to the application's `HomePage`.
This is not needed in order to use `FlexColorScheme` based themes. It is done to be able to show
the active color scheme's name and description in the examples. At the same time it provides the right color data for 
the 3-way theme mode switch `FlexThemeModeSwitch`. The switch uses the light and dark scheme colors in its theme 
mode option buttons. This way the theme mode option buttons always show the 4 main colors in 
the active light and dark color scheme.

### Optional FlexThemeModeSwitch

One unique feature on the `HomePage` of all the examples is the `FlexThemeModeSwitch`. It is the UI Widget used
for the 3-way theme mode switch used in all the examples to change the active theme mode.

<img src="https://github.com/rydmike/flex_color_scheme/blob/master/resources/theme_mode_switch.png?raw=true" alt="theme mode switch" width="350"/>

Using the switch is very simple, give it the currently selected and active theme mode, the current `FlexSchemeData`
scheme, so it can color its buttons correctly, and use the `onThemeModeChanged` callback for changes to its mode.
Then change the `themeMode` property in the `MaterialApp` accordingly, to actually change the used theme mode.

```dart
FlexThemeModeSwitch(
  themeMode: themeMode,
  onThemeModeChanged: onThemeModeChanged,
  flexSchemeData: flexSchemeData,
),
```

Using the `FlexThemeModeSwitch` 3-way theme mode switch is optional and not required to
use `FlexColorScheme` based themes. It is just a unique theme mode switch design and was included
as a bonus feature in the `FlexColorScheme` package. It was added based on a request after it
had been observed in the wild in the Flexfold demo app.

In the Flexfold demo app the switch was originally a fairly fixed design. This `FlexThemeModeSwitch` has many
properties that allow you to customize it extensively. You can find its [API
reference here](https://pub.dev/documentation/flex_color_scheme/latest/flex_color_scheme/FlexThemeModeSwitch-class.html)
and its companion, the `FlexThemeModeOptionButton`
[API reference here](https://pub.dev/documentation/flex_color_scheme/latest/flex_color_scheme/FlexThemeModeOptionButton-class.html).
With the API you can customize the look of the `FlexThemeModeSwitch`, here are some examples:

<img src="https://github.com/rydmike/flex_color_scheme/blob/master/resources/ThemeSwitchCustomize.png?raw=true" alt="theme mode customize"/>

The `FlexThemeModeOptionButton` is typically used by the `FlexThemeModeSwitch`, but it can also be used as a part
of other theme related indicator widgets. Like for example the scrolling horizontal list used in the Flexfold demo app.
Where it is used as a theme indicator in a list, as a way to show all available themes and select the active theme,
just as an alternative to the rather plain popup menu.

## Example 1 - Use a Predefined Color Scheme

The first and simplest example shows how you can use a predefined color scheme in `FlexColorScheme` to
define light and dark themes using the scheme, and then switch between the light and dark mode. A theme showcase
widget shows the theme with several common Material widgets.

This example is basically a repeat of the Flutter default counter app modification earlier, but with a different
`HomePage` and a way to change the `MaterialApp` active `themeMode` property value via the `FlexThemeModeSwitch`
switch on the `HomePage`, using a normal value changed callback function.

 ```dart
void main() => runApp(const DemoApp());

class DemoApp extends StatefulWidget {
  const DemoApp({Key key}) : super(key: key);
  @override
  _DemoAppState createState() => _DemoAppState();
}

class _DemoAppState extends State<DemoApp> {
  // Used to select if we use the dark or light theme.
  ThemeMode themeMode = ThemeMode.light;

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Define which predefined FlexScheme to use.
    // Go ahead and try some other ones too.
    const FlexScheme usedFlexScheme = FlexScheme.mandyRed;
    return MaterialApp(
      debugShowCheckedModeBanner: false,
      title: 'FlexColorScheme',
      // A light scheme, passed to FlexColorScheme.light factory, then use
      // toTheme to return the resulting theme to the MaterialApp theme.
      theme: FlexColorScheme.light(
        scheme: usedFlexScheme,
        // Use comfortable on desktops instead of compact, devices use default.
        visualDensity: FlexColorScheme.comfortablePlatformDensity,
      ).toTheme,
      // Same thing for the dark theme, but using FlexColorScheme.dark factory.
      darkTheme: FlexColorScheme.dark(
        scheme: usedFlexScheme,
        visualDensity: FlexColorScheme.comfortablePlatformDensity,
      ).toTheme,
      // Use the above dark or light theme, based on active themeMode
      // value light/dark/system.
      themeMode: themeMode,
      // The HomePage, with its properties. In this example we pass it the
      // current themeMode, change it via its call-back. We also pass the
      // currently used FlexSchemeData to the HomePage so we can use it to 
      // display some info about it, and use the colors on the theme switch.
      home: HomePage(
        themeMode: themeMode,
        onThemeModeChanged: (ThemeMode mode) {
          setState(() { themeMode = mode; });
        },
        // Pass in the used active FlexSchemeData so we can
        // use its properties on the HomePage.
        flexSchemeData: FlexColor.schemes[usedFlexScheme],
      ),
    );
  }
}

```

> **One more minor addition - visualDensity**  
> All examples in this package use **comfortable** adaptive platform visual density via
> `FlexColorScheme.comfortablePlatformDensity`, instead of the **default** counter application's
> `VisualDensity.adaptivePlatformDensity`.
>
> This is an alternative that on desktop applications results in the Flutter
> `comfortable` visual density being used, instead of `compact`. On devices, they both result in the default large
> `standard` visual density that is suitable for small touch devices. This helper function was added to
> provide an easy option for using a bit larger UI elements on desktop and web apps, while keeping the correct
> size for devices.
>
> If the desktop and web versions of the app is used on computers with touch screens, the `comfortable` density provides
> a nice balance. It still looks compact enough to be desktop like, while providing
> a bit more touch friendly space, without looking like an overblown device UI on a desktop.
>
> FlexColorScheme can of course also use the `VisualDensity.adaptivePlatformDensity` value. If you prefer it,
> just replace the line with it. If you do not specify any visual density, the Flutter default density `standard`
> is used on **all platforms**. This creates Material widgets with a lot of white space around and inside them, which
> may not be what you want on Web and Desktop applications, but is the correct choice for small touch devices. The
> visual density feature in Flutter was created to address this difference in design requirement. The built-in
> function `VisualDensity.adaptivePlatformDensity` was added to adapt the density according to used platform. The
> `FlexColorScheme.comfortablePlatformDensity` does the same, but with a bit more white space on desktops.
> Use the one you like and works best for your use case.

### Building and running example 1

When you build and run **example 1** you get a sample application that looks like this in light and dark mode:

<img src="https://github.com/rydmike/flex_color_scheme/blob/master/resources/fcs_phone_ex1al.png?raw=true" alt="ColorScheme example 1 light" width="250"/><img src="https://github.com/rydmike/flex_color_scheme/blob/master/resources/fcs_phone_ex1ad.png?raw=true" alt="ColorScheme example 1 dark" width="250"/>

Try example 1 live on the [**web here**](https://rydmike.com/flexcolorscheme1).

In the app, scroll down to see the theme showcase further below, it presents the theme with common Material widgets.
This simple first example is not using primary color surface branding, it is just a normal theme with a few
convenient fixes for some theme design gaps in Flutter's own themes created with `ThemeData.from` a `ColorScheme`.

## Example 2 - Create a Custom Color Scheme

This example shows how you can define your own `FlexSchemeData` and create `FlexColorScheme` based themes from it.
A theme showcase widget shows the theme with several common Material widgets.

The full code is not shown in the tutorial, please see the code in the package folder
[flex_color_scheme/example/lib/example2](https://github.com/rydmike/flex_color_scheme/tree/master/example/lib/example2/main.dart)
for the entire example.

To make a custom color scheme, we will for simplicity just define it as a constant in this example.
We make a `FlexSchemeData` object with a name, description and scheme colors defined with
`FlexSchemeColor` for the light and matching dark scheme. In this example we use dark purple and deep green
and matching desaturated versions for the dark scheme.

We could also have stored the light and dark scheme in their own FlexSchemeColor objects, or even created them
directly in their respective `colors` property in the light and dark factories. However, since we will also use this
information on the HomePage for the theme switch widget and to display the scheme name and description, putting them
in a FlexSchemeData object that contains both the light and dark scheme, plus its name and description, is a
convenient way to re-use the information.

```dart
const FlexSchemeData customFlexScheme = FlexSchemeData(
  name: 'Toledo purple',
  description: 'Purple theme created from custom defined colors.',
  light: FlexSchemeColor(
    primary: Color(0xFF4E0028),
    primaryVariant: Color(0xFF320019),
    secondary: Color(0xFF003419),
    secondaryVariant: Color(0xFF002411),
  ),
  dark: FlexSchemeColor(
    primary: Color(0xFF9E7389),
    primaryVariant: Color(0xFF775C69),
    secondary: Color(0xFF738F81),
    secondaryVariant: Color(0xFF5C7267),
  ),
);
```
> **NOTE:** The above custom color scheme is fairly close to the built-in scheme
**Barossa**. If you like it, you can probably use it instead. It is not
exactly the same though. The 'Barossa' variant is tuned a bit differently.
The 'Barossa' theme was introduced in version 1.4.1, and was inspired
and based on this example.

Then we use this `FlexSchemeData` **customFlexScheme** instance `light` and `dark` properties as scheme `colors`
for the `FlexColorScheme.light` and `dark` factory for each theme mode and `toTheme` to get the themes they define.

This setup is totally equivalent to how we used one of the built-in predefined `FlexSchemeData` objects in example 1,
in this case we just defined our own custom `FlexSchemeData` in `customFlexScheme`.

```dart
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      debugShowCheckedModeBanner: false,
      title: 'FlexColorScheme',
      // The color scheme for the light theme, made toTheme
      theme: FlexColorScheme.light(
        colors: customFlexScheme.light,
        visualDensity: FlexColorScheme.comfortablePlatformDensity,
      ).toTheme,
      // The color scheme for the dark theme, made toTheme
      darkTheme: FlexColorScheme.dark(
        colors: customFlexScheme.dark,
        visualDensity: FlexColorScheme.comfortablePlatformDensity,
      ).toTheme,
      // Demo home page, same as in example 1
      home: HomePage(
        themeMode: themeMode,
        onThemeModeChanged: (ThemeMode mode) {
          setState(() { themeMode = mode; });
        },
        // We use our custom FlexSchemeData on the HomePage too.
        flexSchemeData: customFlexScheme,
      ),
    );
  }
}
```
When you build and run **example 2** you get a sample application that looks like this in light and dark mode:

<img src="https://github.com/rydmike/flex_color_scheme/blob/master/resources/fcs_phone_ex2al.png?raw=true" alt="ColorScheme example 2 light" width="250"/><img src="https://github.com/rydmike/flex_color_scheme/blob/master/resources/fcs_phone_ex2ad.png?raw=true" alt="ColorScheme example 2 dark" width="250"/>

Try example 2 live on the [**web here**](https://rydmike.com/flexcolorscheme2).

Scroll down to see the theme showcase widgets further below, presenting the theme with some widgets. This example is
not using primary color surface branding, it is just a normal theme with a few convenient fixes for certain
theme properties.

## Example 3 - Switch Between Different Color Schemes

This example shows how you can use three built-in color schemes, add a custom scheme and then use all four as
selectable `FlexColorScheme` based theme options in an application. The example also uses strong branded surface
colors. A theme showcase widget shows the theme with several common Material widgets.

The full example code is not shown here, please see the code in the package folder
[flex_color_scheme/example/lib/example3](https://github.com/rydmike/flex_color_scheme/tree/master/example/lib/example3/main.dart)
for the entire example.

The **customFlexScheme** `FlexSchemeData` definition is the same as in example 2, it is not repeated below.
In the example below, if we select the `FlexScheme.custom` option, we use our **customFlexScheme** object, otherwise
the selected built-in scheme we selected on the HomePage is used. We also set the surface style to
`FlexSurface.strong`, for a strong primary color branded blend in surfaces and backgrounds.

 ```dart
 class _DemoAppState extends State<DemoApp> {
   ThemeMode themeMode = ThemeMode.light;
   // Used to store which FlexSchemeData option we selected
   FlexScheme flexScheme = FlexScheme.hippieBlue; // Default selected theme

   @override
   Widget build(BuildContext context) {
     return MaterialApp(
       debugShowCheckedModeBanner: false,
       title: 'FlexColorScheme',
       theme: FlexColorScheme.light(
         // When we select the custom FlexScheme on the home
         // page, we get the custom enum value back and use the custom
         // scheme we defined, otherwise we use the selected scheme
         // from the the built in map.
         colors: flexScheme == FlexScheme.custom
             ? customFlexScheme.light
             : FlexColor.schemesWithCustom[flexScheme].light,
         // This surface style gives a strong blend of primary
         // color on surfaces and background colors.
         surfaceStyle: FlexSurface.strong,
         visualDensity: FlexColorScheme.comfortablePlatformDensity,
       ).toTheme,
       // Just a repeat with equivalent setup for the dark theme.
       darkTheme: FlexColorScheme.dark(
         colors: flexScheme == FlexScheme.custom
             ? customFlexScheme.dark
             : FlexColor.schemesWithCustom[flexScheme].dark,
         surfaceStyle: FlexSurface.strong,
         visualDensity: FlexColorScheme.comfortablePlatformDensity,
       ).toTheme,
       themeMode: themeMode,

       home: HomePage(
         themeMode: themeMode,
         onThemeModeChanged: (ThemeMode mode) {
           setState(() { themeMode = mode; });
         },
         // We pass the enum value of the active scheme to the HomePage.
         flexScheme: flexScheme,
         // Where we can select a new scheme and get its enum value back.
         onFlexSchemeChanged: (FlexScheme selectedScheme) {
           setState(() { flexScheme = selectedScheme; });
         },
         // We take care to pass in selected built-in scheme data
         // or the custom one we made if it is selected.
         flexSchemeData: flexScheme == FlexScheme.custom
             ? customFlexScheme
             : FlexColor.schemesWithCustom[flexScheme],
       ),
     );
   }
 }
 ```

In this example on the **HomePage** we removed the option to allow the theme mode to depend on the system theme mode
setting, by setting `showSystemMode` to `false`, thus removing this option from the switch.

```dart
  FlexThemeModeSwitch(
    themeMode: themeMode,
    onThemeModeChanged: onThemeModeChanged,
    flexSchemeData: flexSchemeData,
    // We don't show the system mode option button
    showSystemMode: false,
  ),
```

These are the four resulting different themes with their light and dark modes, that we can select and
use with this example.

**Hippie blue** scheme in light and dark mode.

Try example 3 live on the [**web here**](https://rydmike.com/flexcolorscheme3).

## Example 4 - Switch Between Built-in Color Schemes and Custom Ones

This example shows how you can use all the built-in color schemes, plus three custom schemes.
How to interactively select which one of these schemes is used to define the active theme. The example also uses
medium branded background and surface colors. A theme showcase widget shows the theme with several common Material
widgets. A subpage is also available that shows the same theme applied when opening another page, that in Flutter
just inherits the same theme.

The full example code is not shown here, please see the code in the package folder
[flex_color_scheme/example/lib/example4](https://github.com/rydmike/flex_color_scheme/tree/master/example/lib/example4/main.dart)
for the entire example.

In this example we set the surface style to `FlexSurface.medium`, for medium primary color branded surfaces.

The example is otherwise fairly straight forward. This time we use the built in `FlexColor.schemesList` to access all
the pre-defined `FlexSchemeData` objects as a plain list with the predefined scheme data.
We unpack this list with the spread operator into a new custom `myFlexSchemes` list, and add our three custom schemes
as `FlexSchemeData` objects to the end of this new list. We then access the list's `FlexSchemeData` objects with
an index number, that we simply change with a popup menu on the HomePage.
That is the general principle, let's go through it step by step.

Begin by defining the same colors that we used in example 2 and 3 for our first custom color. In this
case we also assign the same color that we used for our `secondaryVariant` scheme color, to the optional `appBarColor`.
This is done because the built-in schemes use their secondary variant color as their custom app bar color, it could
of course be any color, but for consistency we will do the same for our custom `FlexSchemeColor` data objects. This
part is not actually used in this example yet, but we will re-use these custom definitions in example 5 where it is
used, so we might as well add it now to make the explanations for example 5 a bit shorter.

We mix it up a bit by first defining the light and dark `FlexSchemeColor` data objects, that we will use as
light and dark matched pairs in the `FlexSchemeData` that we are going to add to our list.

```dart
 void main() => runApp(const DemoApp());
 // Create a custom flex color scheme for a light theme.
 const FlexSchemeColor myScheme1Light = FlexSchemeColor(
   primary: Color(0xFF4E0028),
   primaryVariant: Color(0xFF320019),
   secondary: Color(0xFF003419),
   secondaryVariant: Color(0xFF002411),
   appBarColor: Color(0xFF002411),
 );
 // Create a corresponding custom flex color scheme for a dark theme.
 const FlexSchemeColor myScheme1Dark = FlexSchemeColor(
   primary: Color(0xFF9E7389),
   primaryVariant: Color(0xFF775C69),
   secondary: Color(0xFF738F81),
   secondaryVariant: Color(0xFF5C7267),
   appBarColor: Color(0xFF5C7267),
 );
```

We can build a scheme the long way, by specifying all the required hand-picked scheme colors, like above, or we can
also build schemes from a single primary color. With the `FlexSchemeColor.from` factory. With the factory the
only required color is the primary color, the other colors will be computed. You can optionally also provide the
`primaryVariant`, `secondary` and `secondaryVariant` colors with the factory as well, but any color that is not
provided will always be computed for the full set of required colors in a `FlexSchemeColor`.

In this example we create our 2nd scheme from just a primary color for the light and dark schemes. The custom
`appBarColor` will in this case also receive the same color value as the one that is computed for `secondaryVariant`
color, this is the default with the `FlexSchemeColor.from` factory if the color is not specified. The used example
color is an olive green like color.

```dart
 final FlexSchemeColor myScheme2Light =
   FlexSchemeColor.from(primary: const Color(0xFF4C4E06));

 final FlexSchemeColor myScheme2Dark =
   FlexSchemeColor.from(primary: const Color(0xFF9D9E76));
```

For our 3rd custom scheme we will define `primary` and `secondary` colors for the light color scheme, but no
variant colors. We will not make any dark scheme definitions at all. The primary color is "Oregon" orange,
and the used secondary color is a complementary dark teal like color.

```dart
 final FlexSchemeColor myScheme3Light = FlexSchemeColor.from(
   primary: const Color(0xFF993200),
   secondary: const Color(0xFF1B5C62),
 );
```

Next we create a list with all the `FlexSchemeData` objects we will use as our schemes in this example,
starting with all the built-in ones and adding our three custom ones at the end.

>A **FlexSchemeData** object stores `name` and `description` plus the matching `FlexSchemeColor` for `light`
>and `dark` mode color schemes. As a rule of thumb, the dark scheme colors must be less saturated than its light
>scheme colors used for a light theme. Using the same colors in a light and dark color schemes seldom produce nice
>looking or very usable dark and light theme mode pairs. You can read more in the Material Design guide about
>selecting suitable [dark theme colors](https://www.material.io/design/color/dark-theme.html#usage).

We first unpack the predefined `FlexSchemeData` into the list `myFlexSchemes` with the spread operator, add our
own light and dark scheme definition pairs as `FlexSchemeData` to the end. For our last custom `FlexSchemeColor`
`myScheme3Light` that we did not make a matching dark scheme for, we instead use the `.toDark()` method on
the light scheme, to get one automatically computed from the defined light scheme colors.

```dart
 final List<FlexSchemeData> myFlexSchemes = <FlexSchemeData>[
   // Add ALL the predefined FlexColor schemes
   ...FlexColor.schemesList,
   // Then add our first custom schemes to the FlexSchemeData list.
   const FlexSchemeData(
     name: 'Toledo purple',
     description: 'Purple theme, created from full custom defined color scheme.',
     light: myScheme1Light,
     dark: myScheme1Dark,
   ),
   // Do the same for our second custom scheme.
   FlexSchemeData(
     name: 'Olive green',
     description: 'Olive green theme, created from primary light and dark colors.',
     light: myScheme2Light,
     dark: myScheme2Dark,
   ),
   FlexSchemeData(
     name: 'Oregon orange',
     description: 'Custom orange and blue theme, from only light scheme colors.',
     light: myScheme3Light,
     // We create the dark desaturated colors from the light scheme.
     dark: myScheme3Light.toDark(),
   ),
 ];
```

The setup of the stateful MaterialApp is just as simple as in the previous examples.

```dart
 class _DemoAppState extends State<DemoApp> {
   ThemeMode themeMode = ThemeMode.light;
   // Used to select which FlexSchemeData we currently use in our list.
   int themeIndex = 6; // Start with index 6, the brand blue colors.

   @override
   Widget build(BuildContext context) {
     return MaterialApp(
       debugShowCheckedModeBanner: false,
       title: 'FlexColorScheme',
       // Light theme definition.
       theme: FlexColorScheme.light(
         // As scheme colors we use the one from our list
         // pointed to by the current themeIndex.
         colors: myFlexSchemes[themeIndex].light,
         // Medium strength surface branding used in this example.
         surfaceStyle: FlexSurface.medium,
         visualDensity: FlexColorScheme.comfortablePlatformDensity,
       ).toTheme,
       // Just a repeat with equivalent setup for the dark theme.
       darkTheme: FlexColorScheme.dark(
         colors: myFlexSchemes[themeIndex].dark,
         surfaceStyle: FlexSurface.medium,
        visualDensity: FlexColorScheme.comfortablePlatformDensity,
       ).toTheme,

       themeMode: themeMode,

       home: HomePage(
         themeMode: themeMode,
         onThemeModeChanged: (ThemeMode mode) {
           setState(() { themeMode = mode; });
         },
         // We pass the index of the active theme to the HomePage.
         schemeIndex: themeIndex,
         // Where we can select a new theme in a popup menu
         // and get its index back and update state.
         onSchemeChanged: (int index) {
           setState(() { themeIndex = index; });
         },
         // As FlexSchemeData is needed for info on the home
         // page, we just pass the used from out list
         // pointed to by our current themeIndex.
         flexSchemeData: myFlexSchemes[themeIndex],
       ),
     );
   }
 }
 ```

When you build **Example 4**, it starts with the **Brand blues** theme. It is based on a scheme that uses blue colors
found in different well known web brands. The primary blue color in the light scheme might thus look very familiar.

<img src="https://github.com/rydmike/flex_color_scheme/blob/master/resources/fcs_phone_ex4al.png?raw=true" alt="ColorScheme example 4a light" width="250"/><img src="https://github.com/rydmike/flex_color_scheme/blob/master/resources/fcs_phone_ex4bl.png?raw=true" alt="ColorScheme example 4b light" width="250"/>

You can use the popup menu available in the ListTile showing the current theme to change the active theme. You
can choose any of the built-in 28 schemes, plus the three custom color schemes we added. When you change scheme, you
will notice that the active theme color changes are animated by interpolating from the active theme colors,
to the new theme colors. This is a very nice standard feature when you modify the theme used by a Flutter
Material applications.

Try some other theme, here is for example the **Mango mojito** theme.

## Example 5 - Full Featured Demo

This example shows how you can use all the built-in color schemes in FlexColorScheme to define themes from them
and how you can define your own custom scheme colors and use them together with the predefined ones. Like the previous
example, this can give you an idea of how you can create your own complete custom list of color schemes if you do not
want to use any of the predefined ones.

The example also shows how you can use the surface branding feature, vary its strength and how to use the custom app
bar theme features. The usage of the true black theme feature for dark themes, is also demonstrated.
Using the optional Windows desktop like tooltip theme is also shown.

The example includes a dummy responsive side menu and rail to give a visual presentation of what applications
that have larger visible surfaces using the surface branding look like. A theme showcase widget again shows
the theme with several common Material widgets.

A subpage is also available that show that the same active theme is also applied when opening another page.
This is because all the built-in widgets use the same inherited theme and use the colors in the theme in
predefined ways by default. This is also a good example and explanation of why you should use the same theme
colors for your custom re-usable widgets as their default color property values. Then theme your application to
make it look the way you want, rather than defining constants that you apply directly to widget color properties.

If you tried the previous examples on a device, and not on the Web or a built them as desktop targets, you might
have noticed that the system navigation bar on Android devices does not always change. It is not themed to
have matching background and theme mode that matches the active application theme as it changes. This example shows
how this can be fixed and that the used method remain in effect when opening a subpage.

The same custom color schemes as in example 4, are also used in this example. They are not explained here again, please
see [example 4](#example-4---switch-between-built-in-color-schemes-and-custom-ones) for details.
The full example code is not shown here either, please see the code in the package folder
[flex_color_scheme/example/lib/example5](https://github.com/rydmike/flex_color_scheme/tree/master/example/lib/example5/main.dart)
for the entire example's code.

### Example 5 - Local State and Setup

In this example we will be able to toggle the used app bar theme style, the surfaces branding strength,
tooltip style and try the true black theme toggle for dark-mode. This is done so that you can interactively try the
options and see what they do.

You can also use the example to toggle the `tabBarStyle` to use a theme that is designed
to fit in an app bar, regardless of which style you have used for it. This is the default style for this sub theme.
Alternatively you can choose a style that makes a `TabBarTheme` that fits well on background colors. Use this
option if you intend to use the TabBar primarily in a Scaffold body, in dialog or Drawer or other surface and
background colored material, then you do not have re-theme it or style it for that purpose.

We also introduce a toggle that allows us to for all the schemes use the `toDark` computed dark schemes, instead
of the hand tuned built-in ones. You can then compare the results, the `toDark` method does a pretty good job and can
even be tuned with a property if so desired. If you use this toggle on the last custom scheme, you will not see
any difference, because we already created its dark scheme with this method, the toggle just again computes the same
dark scheme. There is also a slider that you can use to adjust the white blend level of the `toDark` method
from its default value of 35%, to be anything from 0...100 %, so you can experiment with it and see what it does.

Additionally, we will include a toggle that allows us to instead of using the `FlexColorScheme.toTheme` method, use
the standard flutter `ThemeData.from` factory to create the theme from the same color scheme definitions.
We can use this toggle to see and study the differences that `FlexColorScheme.toTheme` brings.

```dart
 class _DemoAppState extends State<DemoApp> {
   // Used to select if we use the dark or light theme.
   ThemeMode themeMode = ThemeMode.light;
    // Used to select which FlexSchemeData we use in our list of schemes.
   int themeIndex = 7; // Start with deep blue see theme.
   // Enum used to control primary color branding on surface and background.
   FlexSurface flexSurface = FlexSurface.medium;
   // Enum used to select what app bar style we use.
   FlexAppBarStyle flexAppBarStyle = FlexAppBarStyle.primary;
   // Used to modify the themed app bar elevation.
   double appBarElevation = 0;
   // Used to control if we use one or two toned status bar.
   bool transparentStatusBar = false;
   // Enum used to select what tab bar style we use.
   FlexTabBarStyle flexTabBarStyle = FlexTabBarStyle.forAppBar;
   // If true, tooltip background will be light in light theme, and dark
   // in dark themes. The Flutter Material default and standard is the other
   // way, tooltip background color is inverted compared to app background.
   bool tooltipsMatchBackground = false;
   // Allow toggling between normal dark mode and true black dark mode.
   bool darkIsTrueBlack = false;
   // Allow toggling between using the actual defined dark color scheme or
   // try how it would look if we had not defined the dark colors, but had
   // been lazy and just created the dark scheme from the light scheme
   // with the toDark() method.
   bool useToDarkMethod = false;
   // The 'level' of white blend percentage used when computing dark scheme
   // colors from the light scheme colors with the toDark method.
   int level = 35;
   // Use the toTheme to create Themes from `FlexColorScheme`. This is
   // the preferred method when using `FlexColorScheme`. In the demo
   // you can use a toggle to see what a FlexColorScheme looks like if
   // you the color scheme and `ThemeData.from` to instead create the theme.
   bool useToThemeMethod = true;
```

### Example 5 - The FlexColorScheme Properties and toTheme

We define the light theme for the app, using current theme index, selected surface style and app bar style. With
the built-in 28 themes, and the three custom ones we made, we can use 27 different app themes via the setup below,
times the five surface styles and five app bar variants.

The factory `FlexColorScheme.light` is used to define a `FlexColorScheme` for a light theme, from the light
FlexSchemeColor in the `myFlexSchemes` list, plus some other properties, like the surface and app bar style used in
this example, as well as the tooltip and true black setting for the dark theme.

```dart
   @override
   Widget build(BuildContext context) {
     return MaterialApp(
       debugShowCheckedModeBanner: false,
       title: 'FlexColorScheme',
       theme: useToThemeMethod
         ? FlexColorScheme.light(
             colors: myFlexSchemes[themeIndex].light,
             surfaceStyle: flexSurface,
             appBarStyle: flexAppBarStyle,
             appBarElevation: appBarElevation,
             transparentStatusBar: transparentStatusBar,
             tabBarStyle: flexTabBarStyle,
             tooltipsMatchBackground: tooltipsMatchBackground,
             visualDensity: FlexColorScheme.comfortablePlatformDensity,
             fontFamily: AppFonts.mainFont,
           ).toTheme
```


### Example 5 - The FlexColorScheme Properties and toScheme

We also demonstrate how to create the same theme with the standard from color scheme ThemeData factory
`ThemeData.from`. The surface style works, but will not be applied as elegantly, but it works fairly OK up
to medium branding. The app bar style has no effect, nor the tooltip or tab bar style.

When toggling between the standard `ThemeData.from` and the `FlexColorScheme.toTheme` made themes from the
same `ColorScheme` data, we can observe the differences and see some theme colors that the standard method does
not adjust to match the used color scheme. The previously mentioned 
[article](https://rydmike.com/colorscheme) also includes
a [visual presentation of the differences](https://rydmike.com/colorscheme#the-difference).

```dart
         : ThemeData.from(
             colorScheme: FlexColorScheme.light(
               colors: myFlexSchemes[themeIndex].light,
               surfaceStyle: flexSurface,
               appBarStyle: flexAppBarStyle,
               appBarElevation: appBarElevation,
               transparentStatusBar: transparentStatusBar,
               tabBarStyle: flexTabBarStyle,
               tooltipsMatchBackground: tooltipsMatchBackground,
               visualDensity: FlexColorScheme.comfortablePlatformDensity,
               fontFamily: AppFonts.mainFont,
             ).toScheme,
           ).copyWith(
             visualDensity: FlexColorScheme.comfortablePlatformDensity,
             typography: Typography.material2018(
               platform: defaultTargetPlatform,
             ),
           ),
```

To make this switch work interactively we also have to make sure we use the same typography as the one used
in FlexColorScheme, otherwise the animated theme will show an assertion error, since it cannot animate between the
different defaults for the used typography. To fix this, we use the same nicer and newer typography that is used 
by default by FlexColorScheme based themes. We also add the visual density to 
the ThemeData with the same `copyWith` so we get the same Widget spacing as the one used in out `toTheme` setup. 

**IMPORTANT**  
When using FlexColorScheme and making themes with it, you would normally **NOT USE THE ABOVE toScheme APPROACH**.
It is **ONLY** included in this example to be able to demonstrate the theme adjustments provided by 
`FlexColorScheme.toTheme`. That being said, it is as shown totally possible to do so if you for some reasons prefer
the results with the `toScheme` approach. By doing so you do however loose most of the end results and features
offered by `FlexColorScheme`. You can see an example visual comparison and presentation of the
[**differences here**](https://rydmike.com/colorscheme#the-difference).

The used `FlexColorScheme.light` properties `appBarStyle`, `appBarElevation`, `tabBarStyle`, 
`tooltipsMatchBackground` and `visualDensity` in the example above, actually have
no impact at all on the returned `ColorScheme` by `toScheme`. It can only return colors in a `ColorScheme`, 
that of course have no such theming concepts. Definition of these values above could just as well be removed in the
above example, but they were left in there to demonstrate that for this NOT recommended FlexColorScheme theme 
definition method, they have no impact on the end result. Only properties that adjust scheme colors, 
like `colors`, `scheme`, `surfaceStyle` and `usedColors` will have an impact on the `toScheme` 
returned by **FlexColorScheme**.

### Example 5 - Equivalent Setup for the Dark Theme, but with More Options

We do the equivalent definition for the dark theme, and we add
the true black option as well. We also use the `useToDarkMethod` boolean as switch for `colors` to pass it a
`FlexSchemeColor` that is either using the predefined ones or computes it from its light `FlexSchemeColor`.

For the `toDark` calculation we give it the level property that allows us to tune the dark conversion with
the slider in the UI. We also use the `defaultError` modifier. This ensures that the resulting computed
toDark scheme will ignore any existing light scheme error color definition, and use Material default dark mode
error color as its error color. Without this modifier, toDark will also compute the error color for the
dark scheme from the light scheme's error color. It will thus also change with the level adjustment.
This is certainly also a usable option, but in this example we do not want this behavior.

```dart
     darkTheme: useToThemeMethod
       ? FlexColorScheme.dark(
          colors: useToDarkMethod
             ? myFlexSchemes[themeIndex].light.defaultError.toDark(level)
             : myFlexSchemes[themeIndex].dark,
           surfaceStyle: flexSurface,
           appBarStyle: flexAppBarStyle,
           appBarElevation: appBarElevation,
           transparentStatusBar: transparentStatusBar,
           tabBarStyle: flexTabBarStyle,
           tooltipsMatchBackground: tooltipsMatchBackground,
           darkIsTrueBlack: darkIsTrueBlack,
           visualDensity: FlexColorScheme.comfortablePlatformDensity,
           fontFamily: AppFonts.mainFont,
         ).toTheme

       : ThemeData.from(
           colorScheme: FlexColorScheme.dark(
             colors: useToDarkMethod
               ? myFlexSchemes[themeIndex].light.defaultError.toDark(level)
               : myFlexSchemes[themeIndex].dark,
             surfaceStyle: flexSurface,
             appBarStyle: flexAppBarStyle,
             appBarElevation: appBarElevation,
             transparentStatusBar: transparentStatusBar,
             tabBarStyle: flexTabBarStyle,
             tooltipsMatchBackground: tooltipsMatchBackground,
             darkIsTrueBlack: darkIsTrueBlack,
             visualDensity: FlexColorScheme.comfortablePlatformDensity,
             fontFamily: AppFonts.mainFont,
           ).toScheme,
         ).copyWith(
             visualDensity: FlexColorScheme.comfortablePlatformDensity,
             typography: Typography.material2018(
             platform: defaultTargetPlatform,
           ),
         ),
```

> **What does defaultError actually do?**  
> The `defaultError` modifier creates a new copy of the object, where `error` color is null.
> This causes the `toDark` method to skip it and keep it as null, it then gets the default Material error via
> the `toTheme` method. For the custom `FlexSchemeColor` objects we made for example 4 and 5, we did not specify
> any error color, so they are already `null` and get the default fixed Material error in dark mode anyway.
> However, the built-in schemes do specify their error color for both their light and dark schemes, mostly they use
> the same Material default error color, but some red colored schemes use the high contrast Material error
> color. Because the light error color is defined, if we do not want `toDark` to compute a dark scheme error color that
> changes with the level, we can modify its value to null before `toDark` is used.

### Example 5 - Passing All the Values Back and Forth to the HomePage

The rest of the additions in the stateful MaterialApp are just passing in current values and getting a new value for
it via callbacks for all our settings and their current values.

It is certainly getting tedious to do it this way by now, but since it was stated that we would not add any 
advanced state management solution or verbose inherited widget to these bundled examples. We are sticking to this 
way in this more complex example as well. Let it at the same time be a good example of why and when a state management 
solution should really be considered.

```dart
       // themeMode value and change callback.
       themeMode: themeMode,
       home: HomePage(
         themeMode: themeMode,
         onThemeModeChanged: (ThemeMode mode) {
           setState(() { themeMode = mode; });
         },
         // Used theme index and change callback.
         schemeIndex: themeIndex,
         onSchemeChanged: (int index) {
           setState(() { themeIndex = index;});
         },
         // Used surface branding and change callback.
         themeSurface: flexSurface,
         onThemeSurfaceChanged: (FlexSurface surface) {
           setState(() { flexSurface = surface; });
         },
         // Used app bar style and change callback.
         appBarStyle: flexAppBarStyle,
         onAppBarStyleChanged: (FlexAppBarStyle style) {
           setState(() { flexAppBarStyle = style; });
         },
         // Used transparentStatusBar and change callback.
         transparentStatusBar: transparentStatusBar,
         onTransparentStatusBarChanged: (bool value) {
           setState(() {transparentStatusBar = value; });
         },
         // Used app bar elevation and change value callback.
         appBarElevation: appBarElevation,
         onAppBarElevationChanged: (double value) {
           setState(() { appBarElevation = value; });
         },
         // Used tab bar style and change callback.
         tabBarStyle: flexTabBarStyle,
         onTabBarStyleChanged: (FlexTabBarStyle style) {
           setState(() { flexTabBarStyle = style; });
         },
         // Used tooltip style and change callback.
         tooltipsMatchBackground: tooltipsMatchBackground,
         onTooltipsMatchBackgroundChanged: (bool value) {
           setState(() { tooltipsMatchBackground = value; });
         },
         // True black mode and change callback.
         darkIsTrueBlack: darkIsTrueBlack,
         onDarkIsTrueBlackChanged: (bool value) {
           setState(() { darkIsTrueBlack = value; });
         },
         // Dark scheme method and toggle method callback.
         useToDark: useToDarkMethod,
         onUseToDarkChanged: (bool value) {
           setState(() { useToDarkMethod = value; });
         },
        // Dark scheme white blend level and change callback.
         whiteBlend: level,
         onWhiteBlendChanged: (int value) {
           setState(() { level = value; });
         },
         // Theme creation method and toggle method callback.
         useToTheme: useToThemeMethod,
         onUseToThemeChanged: (bool value) {
           setState(() { useToThemeMethod = value; });
         },
         // And pass the current FlexSchemeData to the
         // homePage so we can use some info from it.
         // We use copyWith to modify the dark scheme to
         // the colors we get from toggling the switch
         // for computed dark colors or the actual defined
         // dark colors.
         flexSchemeData: myFlexSchemes[themeIndex].copyWith(
           dark: useToDarkMethod
             ? myFlexSchemes[themeIndex].light.toDark()
             : myFlexSchemes[themeIndex].dark),
       ),
     );
   }
 }
```

With this example we include a side rail, it expands to a menu on desktop/web when using a larger
canvas, it even does this in phone landscape mode. This just a dummy for demo purposes. It is here to give a better
idea and presentation of what a surface branded theme looks like. The effect is best viewed and experienced
on a tablet, or the with a desktop browser via the live web demo, where the surface branded
theming effect is more obvious.

### Example 5 - Themed System Navigation Bar in Android

The HomePage's build method for this example starts by wrapping the entire page content in an `AnnotatedRegion`
with a `SystemUiOverlayStyle` value that we get from the static helper
`FlexColorScheme.themedSystemNavigationBar(context, ...)`. 

Using this we can get a system navigation bar, typically on older Android phones that still uses one, that 
follows the active theme's background color and theme mode. The system navigation bar will get updated as 
you select new themes, different background color branding style and strength, and 
toggle dark and light theme mode. Many Flutter applications neglect or forget to include this feature in their themes.

```dart
   return AnnotatedRegion<SystemUiOverlayStyle>(
     value: FlexColorScheme.themedSystemNavigationBar(
       context,
       systemNavBarStyle: systemNavBarStyle,
       useDivider: useSysNavDivider,
     ),
     child: ....
   );
```

Above the `systemNavBarStyle` is a local `FlexSystemNavBarStyle` state variable tied to the same UI choice in the demo
home screen and `useSysNavDivider` is local bool state variable. Together with the option to remove the status bar 
scrim, you can have easy complete control of both the AppBar's status bar, and the system navigation bar look, 
like shown below:

<img src="https://github.com/rydmike/flex_color_scheme/blob/master/resources/FlexSchemeAppBar.gif?raw=true" alt="AppBar StatusBar" width="250"/><img src="https://github.com/rydmike/flex_color_scheme/blob/master/resources/FlexSchemeNavBar.gif?raw=true" alt="SysNavBar Style" width="250"/>

> **NOTE:**  
> The static helper `FlexColorScheme.themedSystemNavigationBar(context, ...)` is designed to provide a convenience
> wrapper for a `SystemUiOverlayStyle` that works for screens that use and adhere to current theme mode colors.
> If your application use screens that do not follow the current theme, then just use `SystemUiOverlayStyle`
> directly in the annotated region for such screens to define their desired style. You can also make your own 
> convenience wrapper function or even just a const value for it if you need to use a fixed style and design frequently.

You can also use the `FlexColorScheme.themedSystemNavigationBar` to hide the top status icons if you are not
using an app bar at all. This can be useful e.g. on a splash or onboarding page. Example 5 contains 3 different
examples, each with their own limitations, read more in the example 5 source code comments on how it
can be used, here what they look like. The last Example SplashPage 2, would be the ideal version, and it 
works well on some versions of Android, but seems to fail on newer ones, so you may prefer 1b instead.

### Example 5 - Building the Example

The above concludes the code walk through of example 5. When we build it, the example starts with 
the **deep blue sea** scheme. In the example below we can also see the correctly
themed system navigation bar on the Android device.

<img src="https://github.com/rydmike/flex_color_scheme/blob/master/resources/fcs_phone_ex5al.png?raw=true" alt="ColorScheme example 5 light" width="250"/><img src="https://github.com/rydmike/flex_color_scheme/blob/master/resources/fcs_phone_ex5ad.png?raw=true" alt="ColorScheme example 5 dark" width="250"/>

Try example 5 live on the [**web here**](https://rydmike.com/flexcolorscheme5)

### Example 5 - Computed Dark Theme

Since example 5 allows us to toggle the dark mode from using its hand tuned predefined dark scheme colors, to the
dark scheme colors computed from the light scheme colors. Let's use that feature study and compare some examples.

With the above **deep blue sea** scheme, the computed ones are a bit more dull and muted in this example.
These screenshots are using medium surface branding, the computed dark scheme is on the right.

<img src="https://github.com/rydmike/flex_color_scheme/blob/master/resources/fcs_phone_ex5ad.png?raw=true" alt="ColorScheme example 5 dark" width="250"/><img src="https://github.com/rydmike/flex_color_scheme/blob/master/resources/fcs_phone_ex5ad-to-black.png?raw=true" alt="ColorScheme example 5 dark computed" width="250"/>

With some other schemes, like the **Aqua blue** one there is only a minor difference. These screenshots
are using strong surface branding, the computed dark scheme is on the right.

<img src="https://github.com/rydmike/flex_color_scheme/blob/master/resources/fcs_phone_ex5a2d.png?raw=true" alt="ColorScheme example 5a2 dark" width="250"/><img src="https://github.com/rydmike/flex_color_scheme/blob/master/resources/fcs_phone_ex5a2d-to-black.png?raw=true" alt="ColorScheme example 5 dark computed" width="250"/>

### Example 5 - Computed Dark Theme with Level Adjustment

The result of the `toDark` method varies depending on how saturated the used light scheme colors are. It is possible
to tune the calculated dark scheme by modifying the `whiteBlend` property it uses to blend in white to make the
dark scheme. The default `whiteBlend` is 35%, this is normally a suitable value. For more saturated light scheme
colors try 40%, which is also used in the Material design guide to convert the default red error color for light mode,
to dark mode. For light scheme color with low saturation, a white blend of 20...30% often also produces nice results.

With the included level slider in the example we can interactively change the `whiteBlend` level for the computed
dark mode scheme colors. Let's select a color scheme, say the **Brand blues** one, then go dark.
By default, the built-in predefined hand-picked matching dark scheme colors for the dark theme mode are used.

Turn on the "Compute dark theme" mode, the result is pretty close to the predefined one for this dark scheme with
the default level of 35%. Then adjust the white level blend to tune how saturated the computed dark scheme colors are
compared to their light scheme master. At 0% they are the same as the light scheme, at 100%, well then they are white,
not so useful. A range of 10...50% can produce excellent results. What is best depends on how saturated your starting
light scheme colors are, and of course what kind of matching dark theme look you like and want. If you use the even
darker dark-mode, **true black**, you may want to have a different saturation for your dark scheme colors compared to
standard dark-mode surface. You could easily implement that adjustment with this feature.

This screen recording compares the computed `toDark` theme result, to the built-in hand-picked one.
It does this by toggling the mode a few times, so you can compare the different results. It also uses the level slider
to adjust the `toDark` theme result. A sharp eye might notice that this recording does not use the `defaultError`
error color modifier, the changing dark error color does not look so nice when tuning the computed scheme colors.
The bundled example 5 and live web version of it uses the modifier.

### Example 5 - Branded Surfaces and App Bar Options

Let us now explore the effect of branded surface colors. Branded surfaces are often
associated with dark mode, but it works well with light mode too when applied delicately. Below you can see how
the primary color gets blended into Material surface and even stronger so, into Material background colors.
The screenshots below are using the medium branding strength.

You can use the toggle in the example to change from standard no branded surfaces colors, to light, medium,
strong and heavy.

The scaffold background does not receive any branding until the heavy mode. You might think that this and all
the other theming can be done by just passing the same scheme colors to the `ThemeData.from` factory. That is why
this demo allows you to flip a switch to do just that, so you can see and observe the difference between
color scheme based themes created by `FlexColorScheme.toTheme` and `ThemeData.from`.

<img src="https://github.com/rydmike/flex_color_scheme/blob/master/resources/fcs_phone_ex5bl.png?raw=true" alt="ColorScheme example 5b light" width="250"/><img src="https://github.com/rydmike/flex_color_scheme/blob/master/resources/fcs_phone_ex5cl.png?raw=true" alt="ColorScheme example 5c light" width="250"/>

Feel free to experiment with
the live web demo where the differences are even easier to observe since you can have both versions open side by
side, in a large browser windows. A ready-made example comparison can be
found [here](https://rydmike.com/colorscheme#the-difference).

Now that when we tried basic surface color branding, we can test the tricks `FlexColorScheme` can do
with the `AppBarTheme` and how you can match it to your surface branding if you like.

You can easily toggle both dark and light mode app bar's to use differently
themed backgrounds than the normal `ColorScheme` primary colored one in light-mode, and dark background in dark-mode,
that you get when you create a theme with `ThemeData.from(colorScheme)`.

Even without using a separately defined `AppBarTheme`, **FlexColorScheme** app bars can use scheme primary color,
the default Material plain white/dark background color, or the primary branded surface, or primary branded
background color, as well as an extra custom app bar scheme color, as the app bar's **themed background** color.

The `FlexColorScheme` scheme's `appBarColor` is a separate scheme color that does not exist in Flutter's standard
`ColorScheme`, so it does not have to be any of the colors available in a `ColorScheme`.
The predefined schemes use the color defined in a `ColorScheme` scheme's `secondaryVariant` color, as their value for
the custom `appBarColor`. When you make your own schemes you can do the same or use a totally none `ColorScheme`
related color as the app bar's custom color option. This color then becomes one of the FlexColorScheme's easy
selectable app bar theme color options, via the `appBarStyle` property and the `FlexAppBarStyle` enum, in this case
via the `custom` choice.

Below you can see some different branding strengths with a background primary color branded app bar theme used.
This example compares medium versus heavy branding. The medium choice is usually well-balanced, but light can be
subtle and nice too. If you want to make a bold statement theme, go with heavy. Please note that the visual
impact of the branding also depends on how saturated the primary color is.

Here are few more images of the heavy primary color branded version, when looking at some widgets as well.

### Example 5 - The TabBar Style

The `tabBarStyle` property can be used to toggle the theme the tab bar receives. By default, a theme that is designed
to make it fit in an app bar, regardless of which style you have selected for it, is used. This is the
`FlexTabBarStyle.forAppBar` style. The typical usage of a TabBar is to have it in an AppBar, and the default style
works for this use case.

Alternatively you can choose a style that makes a `TabBarTheme` that fits well on background colors. Use this
option if you only intend to use the TabBar in a Scaffold body, in Dialogs, Drawers or other surface and
background colored Material, then you do not have re-theme it or style it separately for this purpose.

If you intend to use TabBar widgets in both AppBar's and on surface and backgrounds, you will have to choose the style
that makes most sense for your use case and theme it separately for the other case, just like you have to do
with Flutter standard TabBar theme as well.

Which tab bar style and resulting tab bar theme, actually works best, depends on the background color. Here we see
tab bars used on surfaces and in an app bar, when the app bar is using the primary color. As can be seen, the tab bar
theme that goes well in an app bar in such a case, does not fit on the surfaces at all, and wise versa.

<img src="https://github.com/rydmike/flex_color_scheme/blob/master/resources/TabBar-on-primary.png?raw=true" alt="tab bar on primary"/>

If you plan to use only surface, background (also the branded ones) colored app bars, you can see that both tab bar
styles, and their resulting themes work for both situations. The difference is minor, and it is a matter of opinion
which one is preferable. Both style options can be used if you restrict your app bar color to background colors.
In such a use case you can get away with using just one of the built-in style options, even if you use tab
bars in both app bars and on other surfaces.

<img src="https://github.com/rydmike/flex_color_scheme/blob/master/resources/TabBar-on-surface.png?raw=true" alt="tab bar on surface"/>

### Example 5 - True Black

Dark-mode is nice, but with `FlexColorScheme` you can go even darker, go **true black** with the flick of a
switch. When using the true black option for dark-mode, surface, background and scaffold background are set to
fully black. This can save power on OLED screens as the pixels are turned off, but it can also cause scrolling artefact
issues when pixels turn fully on and off rapidly as you scroll. You can read about this and see an example of it in
the [Material design guide](https://material.io/design/color/dark-theme.html#ui-application)
as well. (Scroll back up one heading from the link to get to the mention of it.)

If you use branded surfaces with true black mode enabled, you will notice that the branding has a lower impact,
only at strong and heavy levels does it have a visible effect. This is by design to keep most surfaces totally or
very close to black when true black is combined with surface branding. If you really want complete black
for all surfaces and backgrounds, then avoid combining true black mode with branded surfaces. On the other hand it
still makes a darker theme than normal dark theme, which can look nice, and it eliminates the scrolling issue since
all background colored pixels are not fully off in the strong and heavy branded true black modes.

Here is an example of a branded dark theme with true black OFF (default and standard) and true black ON,
when using heavy branding with the **Red red wine** color scheme.

Here is another difference example with the **Deep blue sea** scheme, when using medium strength surface branding, and
a primary colored app bar in dark-mode.

## Android Transparent System Navigation Bar

Version 1.4.0 adds experimental support for transparent system navigation bar for Android for SDK >= 30.
The support is added via the new `opacity` property in `FlexColorScheme.themedSystemNavigationBar`.
A separate example that builds on example 5 for this more advanced use case, shows and explains how and when
transparent system navigation bar can be used in Android.

The example also shows how to manage it so that it looks as nice as possible when using primary color branded
background color, applied to the system navigation bar in Android, when transparency is not supported, and your
app uses transparent system navigation bar when running on an API level that supports it.

Please see the separate small stand-alone example Android project called
[**sysnavbar** on GitHub](https://github.com/rydmike/sysnavbar) for full details.

With this experimental feature you can make an Android system navigation that looks like the left one below when
it is supported, but falls back to just being theme color branded, like the right one, on API levels that do not
support it.

The example below uses the classical system navigation bar with the navigation buttons, but it also works when
the phone settings is changed to the much smaller gesture bar or on phones that don't even have a visible gesture
bar.

## Behind the Scenes

**FlexColorScheme** does not actually use the `ThemeData.from` factory with a passed
in `ColorScheme` to make its theme. It uses the `ThemeData` factory directly with some
custom theming. It does of course define a `ColorScheme` that it uses for the `ThemeData`.
FlexColorScheme uses color calculations for the primary color
brand blended surfaces, and for the lazy schemes that do not specify all colors in a color scheme.

### None Null Sub-Themes

Flutter's default Theme and its ThemeData is moving towards a design where all the sub-theme's in the default
ThemeData are NULL. It is always the widget that defines the default behavior and look when its sub-theme and its
properties are null and its properties for the same values are null. The widget colors for such cases are
then defined by `ThemeData.of(context).colorScheme`.

This Flutter theming design goal was described in this
[document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kzIOQN4QYfVsc5lMZgy_A-FWGXBAJBMySGqZqsJytcE). It is mostly implemented
by now, but there might still be some sub-themes in Flutter SDK remaining that do not fully adhere to this design.

FlexColorScheme sets `ThemeData.of(context).colorScheme` to ensure that its colors are applied to all widgets
that adhere to this newer standard. It also sets all still existing legacy colors in
`ThemeData.of(context)`, that some Flutter Widgets still use, to use scheme appropriate or scheme derived colors. Thanks
to this there should not be any built-in Widgets in Flutter that do not get color scheme themed by FlexColorScheme.

The ThemeData created by `FlexColorScheme().toTheme` also tries to not create and modify sub-themes when it does not
have to. However, to meet its design goals, FlexColorScheme has to create a number of sub-themes and set some
of their properties. In some rare cases this is done to correct theming issues in Flutter, but mostly to 
reach its own design goals. Further below is a list of all the sub-themes it creates and properties that you can
**currently** expect to have none null values in them. These sub-themes and their properties, 
would otherwise be null when just using default `ThemeData()` or `ThemeData.from()` factories, if they
did not specify sub-themes.

Even though these sub-themes currently are not null, and have some none null properties, it is still recommended to 
always use a null fallback value if you are accessing ThemeData sub-themes and their properties in
`ThemeData.of(context)`.

For example, when using the Floating Action Button's theme data, don't just use:

```dart
final Color fabColor = Theme.of(context).floatingActionButtonTheme.backgroundColor;
```

It should never be considered fully **safe** to access properties like it without using null fallbacks.
Instead, do something similar to this:

```dart
final Color fabColor = Theme.of(context)?.floatingActionButtonTheme?.backgroundColor ??
  Theme.of(context).colorScheme.secondary;
```

Where we in this example fall back to the color that the FAB widget would use by default, if its sub-theme data or 
its background color is not defined. The above definition is already much safer, if you always expect to find a 
Color value. You can certainly add even more null fallbacks to it, but for them to be needed you probably have 
other use case issues as well.

FlexColorScheme will try to not change past creation of its none null sub-themes, but ultimately changes to these
implementation details are only considered breaking if they produce a theme that is visibly different from
past behavior.

Flutter SDK may also change some of its implementation details of ThemeData. Take for example the broken
Chip case, if it is modified to fix its dark theme bug, then FlexColorScheme would have no reason
for its own fix. In cases where Flutter defaults moves in a direction that the same definition is no longer
needed in FlexColorScheme, such sub-theme definitions may eventually be removed, **but not without due warning**.

One recent such case was actually the `floatingActionButtonTheme` sub-theme that FlexColorScheme created in earlier
versions. The used sub-theme did not change Flutter's default behavior. However, in some older versions of 
Flutter there were a severe deprecation warning if the sub-theme was not defined. Later it was 
observed that Flutter SDK default and FlexColorScheme sub-theme now agrees 100% on the design, and there is
no longer any deprecated warning if the sub-theme is totally removed from FlexColorScheme's theme definition. 
This sub-theme definition was thus no longer needed and was removed starting from FlexColorScheme  
version 2.0.0-nullsafety.2.

* **AppBarTheme** in `ThemeData.appBarTheme` is NOT null.  
  The actual values are defined to match the offered convenience theming options for the AppBar.
  The property values depend on made configuration choices.

  It is defined to fix issue [#65663](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/65663) and uses
  ChipThemeData.fromDefaults to set:
  * secondaryColor: `colorScheme.primary`
  * brightness: `colorScheme.brightness`
  * labelStyle: `textTheme.bodyText1`


* **TabBarTheme** in `ThemeData.tabBarTheme` is NOT null.  
  Its colors depend on if a theme appropriate for current active app bar background color (default), or one for
  background and surface color usage is selected. It sets:
  * indicatorSize: `TabBarIndicatorSize.tab`
  * labelStyle: `TextTheme().button`
  * labelColor: *Depends on selected and targeted main usage.*
  * unselectedLabelColor: *Depends on selected and targeted main usage*.

         : dark ? Colors.black : Colors.white,    
      fontSize: desktop ? 12 : 14)
    ```
  * decoration:

         border: Border.all(color: dividerThemeColor))
     : null // Use default Flutter SDK decoration.
    ```
  
### ThemeData Default Modifications

In addition to the primary color branded surfaces, full shaded schemes from just one primary color, true
black and app bar convenience tricks. The returned `ThemeData` contains some opinionated modifications and theme
corrections compared to what you get if you would just use the standard `ThemeData.from` with a `ColorScheme`.

You can still of course override the returned theme data with your own theme modifications and additions, by using
the `copyWith` method on the resulting theme data object.

The following lists the full details of what the differences compared to the standard `ThemeData.from` factory
are, as well as the rationale behind the made design choices and changes to the defaults.

  * `ScaffoldBackground` has its own color property in `FlexColorScheme`
    and can if so desired differ from the `ColorScheme.background`
    color. In the used surface branding implementation, the `scaffoldBackground`
    typically gets no primary branding applied. Only in the heavy choice
    is there a small amount. Whereas `background` in a FlexColorScheme theme
    receives the most color branding of the surface colors. This fits
    well for where the `background` color is typically used in Material background by Widgets,
    but it does not go so well together with `scaffoldBackground`, which
    is the reason why it has its own color value in this implementation.


  * The `dialogBackgroundColor` uses the `ColorScheme.surface` color
    instead of `ColorScheme.background`. The `background` color needed
    the strongest branding when branding is used, but this did not look
    so good on dialogs, so its color choice was changed to `surface`
    instead, that gets much lighter branding in FlexColorScheme when it is
    used. With standard Material surface colors, the `background` and
    `surface` colors are the same, so there is no difference when using
    the default background and surface colors.


  * The `indicatorColor` is same as effectiveTabColor which uses a function with
    logic to determine its color bases on if a TabBarTheme was selected that should
    work on current app bar background color, or on surface/background colors.


  * For `toggleableActiveColor` the `ColorScheme.secondary` color is used.
    The Flutter default just uses the default `ThemeData` colors and
    not the actual colors you define in the `ColorScheme` you create your
    theme from. Perhaps an oversight in Flutter?
    See issue [#65782](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/65782).


  * Flutter themes created with `ThemeData.from` do not define any color
    scheme related color for the `primaryColorDark` color, this method
    does.  See issue [#65782](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/65782).
    The `ThemeData.from` leaves this color at `ThemeData` factory default,
    this may not match your scheme. Widgets seldom use this color, so the
    issue is rarely seen.


  * Flutter themes created with `ThemeData.from` do not define any color
    scheme based color for the `primaryColorLight` color, this method does.
    See issue [#65782](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/65782).
    The `ThemeData.from` leaves this color at `ThemeData` factory default
    this may not match your scheme. Widgets seldom use this color, so the
    issue is rarely seen.


  * Flutter themes created with `ThemeData.from` do not define any color
    scheme based color for the `secondaryHeaderColor` color, this method
    does. See issue [#65782](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/65782).
    `ThemeData.from` leaves this color at `ThemeData` factory default this
    may not match your scheme. Widgets seldom use this color, so the issue
    is rarely seen.


  * Background color for `AppBarTheme` can use a custom color theme
    in both light and dark themes, that is not dependent on the theme's
    primary or surface color.
    In the versions prior to Flutter 2.0.0 doing this was difficult to do,
    as presented in [#50606](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/50606)
    A new feature in Flutter 2.0.0 implemented via:
    [#71184](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/pull/71184) makes this easy and
    better. FlexColorScheme's implementation has been changed to use this
    new AppBarTheme feature starting from version 2.0.0-nullsafety.2.
    

  * The `AppBarTheme` elevation defaults to 0, an iOs style influenced
    opinionated choice. It can easily be adjusted directly in the
    `FlexColorScheme` definition with property value `appBarElevation`
    without creating a sub theme or using `copyWith`.


  * The `bottomAppBarColor` uses color scheme background color to match the
    background color of the drawer, bottom navigation bar, possible side
    menu and system navigation bar on android (if theming of it is used).
    This is a slight change from the ColorScheme default that uses
    surface color.


  * The `BottomAppBarTheme` elevation defaults to `appBarElevation` or 0 if
    it is null, an iOs style influenced opinionated choice. It can easily
    be adjusted directly in the `FlexColorScheme` definition with property
    value `bottomAppBarElevation` without creating a sub theme or
    using `copyWith`.


  * A deviation from `ThemeData.from` color scheme based theme's is
    that `ThemeData.accentColor` is set to `ColorScheme.primary` and not to
    `secondary` if not otherwise defined. This is done to get an easy way
    for borders on `TextField.decoration` to use theme based primary
    color in dark-mode, and not `accentColor` color.

    There may be a bug in the way
    `InputDecorationTheme` gets used by the `InputDecorator`. We were
    unable to define a theme that would work correctly for such a setup
    without resorting to making `accentColor` equal to
    `ThemeData.primaryColor`. This definition has less of an impact
    visually to any built-in widgets than one might suspect. With all
    the other included theme definitions, we saw no other widget that used
    `accentColor`. FAB and toggles have their own theme and default colors, so
    they still use the default expected `colorScheme.secondary` color
    despite this change.


  * The `accentColor` is made available as a separate scheme property.
    This done to enable control of the `OutlineInputBorder()` active border
    color property in color scheme based themes for dark theme-mode.
    This is just provided as an easy way to override its customized
    definition without using a `copyWith` on the resulting ThemeData.


  * In `TextSelectionThemeData`, the standard for `selectionColor` is
    `colorScheme.primary` with opacity value `0.4` for dark-mode and `0.12`
    for light mode. Here, primary with `0.5` opacity for dark-mode and `0.3` for
    light mode is used. The standard for `selectionHandleColor` is
    `colorScheme.primary`, here we use the slightly darker shade
    `primaryColorDark` instead, which does not have a proper color
    scheme color value in Flutter standard `ColorScheme` based themes.


  * A predefined slightly opinionated `InputDecorationTheme` is used. It
    sets `filled` to `true` and fill color to color scheme primary color
    with opacity `0.035` in light mode and with opacity `0.06` in dark-mode.
    Another theme design change is done via modification of the
    `ThemeData.accentColor` described earlier. Since the used theme, like
    the default theme, does not define a `border` property of `TextField`,
    an app can still easily use both the default underline style, or the
    outline style by just specifying the default `OutlineInputBorder()`
    for the border property when outlined TextField is desired.
    If you don't  want the filled style, or the primary colored
    borders in dark-mode, you can override them back with `copyWith`.
    For totally different border color in dark-mode you can alternatively
    specify it via the `accentColor` property. Which should not affect
    any other color than this border color when using FlexColorScheme
    based themes.


  * The property `fixTextFieldOutlineLabel` is set to `true` by default,
    it looks better. The only reason why it is not the default in Flutter,
    is for default backwards legacy design compatibility.
    

  * **NOTE:**  
    Since the old buttons have been deprecated in Flutter 2.0.0
    they are no longer presented or used in code in FlexColorScheme and its
    examples. However, FlexColorScheme still defines the theme for
    them described below. Defining the theme does not yet cause any
    deprecation warnings or errors, as long as that is the case. this
    theming will be kept available to support out of the box nice themes for
    the old buttons as before.
    
  * Button theming is applied to `ThemeData.buttonColor` using color
    `colorScheme.primary` color.

  * For `ThemeData.buttonTheme` the entire color scheme is passed to its
    `colorScheme` property, and it uses `textTheme` set to
    `ButtonTextTheme.primary`, plus minor changes to padding and tap target
    size. These modifications make the old buttons almost match the
    default design and look of their corresponding newer buttons.
    The `RaisedButton` looks very similar to `ElevatedButton`,
    `OutlineButton` to `OutlinedButton` and `FlatButton` to `TextButton`.
    There are some differences in margins and looks, especially in
    dark-mode, but they are very similar.


  * The default theme for Chips contain a design bug that makes the
    selected `ChoiceChip` widget look disabled in dark-mode, regardless
    if was created with `ThemeData` or `ThemeData.from` factory.
    See issue [#65663](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/65663).
    The `ChipThemeData` modification used here fixes the issue.
    

 * For `TabBarTheme`, the Flutter standard selected tab and indicator
   color is onSurface in dark-mode and onPrimary in light mode, which is
   designed to fit an AppBar colored TabBar. This is kept, and the default
   via `FlexTabBarStyle.forAppBar` style, with a minor modification. If
   AppBar is "light", then black87 is used, not black, it is the same as
   the textTheme on AppBar in light app bar brightness.
   If the `FlexTabBarStyle.forBackground` style was used, the
   selected  color is always color scheme primary color, which works well
   on surface, background and scaffold background colors.

   The unselected TabBar color when `FlexTabBarStyle.forBackground` style
   is used, is always the onSurface color with 60% opacity. This is also
   the color if the AppBar background color brightness is light AND its
   color is white, surface or background colored.
   Otherwise, when the style `FlexTabBarStyle.forAppBar` is used, the
   unselected tab bar color is the selected tab color with 70% opacity.
   This opacity value is the same  as Flutter default for the default
   theme that is also designed for AppBar usage.


  * The `BottomNavigationBarThemeData` uses color scheme primary color for
    the selected item. Flutter defaults to secondary color. Primary color
    is a design used on iOS by default for the bottom navigation bar. We
    agree and think it looks better as the default choice for apps.


  * Default `tooltipTheme` in Flutter is currently a bit flawed on desktop
    and web, because it defaults to using a very small font (10dp).
    See issue [#71429](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/71429).
    The default theming also does not handle multiline tooltips very well.
    The here used `TooltipThemeData` theme design, corrects both these
    issues. It uses 12dp font on desktop and web instead of 10dp,
    and some padding instead of a height constraint to ensure that
    multiline tooltips look nice too.
    
       
  * FlexColorScheme also includes a boolean property
    `tooltipsMatchBackground`, that can be toggled to not use Flutter's
    Material default design that has a theme mode
    inverted background. Tooltips using light background in light theme
    and dark in dark, are commonly used on the Windows desktop platform.
    You can easily tie this extra property to the used platform to make an automatic
    platform adaptation of the tooltip style if you like, or give users
    a preference toggle where they change the tooltip style to their liking.


  * The property `transparentStatusBar` is set to true by default. It is
    used to make to the AppBar one-toned on Android devices, like on iOS devices.
    Set it to `false` if you want to restore the default Android two toned design.
