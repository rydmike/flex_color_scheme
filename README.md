# FlexColorScheme 

[<img src="https://rydmike.com/assets_fcsv4/flutter-favorite-logo.png?raw=true?" alt="flutter favorite logo" width="170"/>](https://docs.flutter.dev/development/packages-and-plugins/favorites) 

Use **FlexColorScheme** to make beautiful color scheme based Flutter themes, 
with optional primary color surface blends. The themes are based on the same 
concept as Flutter's ColorScheme based themes, but with many 
additional features.

_FlexColorScheme theme examples (click image to open hires version)_

When you color theme a Flutter application, all built in 
widgets use the colors of the `ColorScheme` in your theme. At least in theory, 
and it is almost so if you defined your Flutter ThemeData by using the 
`ThemeData.from` factory, but even it misses a few details.
**FlexColorScheme** goes the extra mile to ensure that all Flutter SDK widgets gets 
themed completely by its built-in color schemes, or custom colors you provide.

You can also opt in on using pre-made opinionated widget sub-themes.
By opting in, you can for example adjust the border radius on all widgets 
with a single property to set the same themed border radius on all of them with
one property. Current Flutter SDK widgets are based on the Material 2 guide 
and use 4 dp corner radius as default on most corners.

When you opt in on using the sub themes, the border radius on widgets default 
to the new rounded corners as specified by the 
[Material 3 guide](https://m3.material.io/), where the 
rounding varies by widget type. You can stick with this, or set global 
radius to a value you prefer. You can also easily set the themed border
radius per widget and override the shared radius value in just a few cases. Use 
simple property values per widget, no need for verbose custom sub theme 
Shape definitions.

# What is New in Version 4?

For a detailed list of what is new in version 4, please refer to the 
[change log](https://pub.dev/packages/flex_color_scheme/changelog).

There are two major new features. The first one is that FlexColorScheme 
now comes with **opinionated widget sub themes** that you can opt in on. 
By default, these Flutter UI widget sub themes follow the 
[Material 3 guide](https://m3.material.io/). This is done
as far as reasonably possible while still using standard Material 2 theming features
available in Flutter 2.8. There is a Material 3 style TextTheme as well, and by 
default this text theme is also slightly color tinted using the color 
scheme's primary color. You can turn these styles on and off, based on your
your own preferences when you opt in on the sub themes.

The second main new feature is that FlexColorScheme now offers **9 different surface
color blend modes**, with **40 different blend levels** each. Version 3 only had one
"blend style" with 5 levels, including the no blend option.
The version 3 blend style API is still available and works, but is deprecated
since version 4.2.0. Despite the major version bump from 3 to 4, all APIs from 
version 3 are fully compatible with version 4. The version was mostly bumped 
because it contains so many new features that it made sense.

> ### Looking for version 3 documentation with working image links?
> #### You can find it [here](https://github.com/rydmike/flex_color_scheme/blob/master/README-V3.md).

## New Color Schemes

There are of course new built-in color schemes. Four of them seems to
be the standard for major new releases. The new color schemes are:

* **Blue whale** - Blue whale, jungle green and outrageous tango orange
* **San Juan** - San Juan blue and pink salmon theme
* **Rosewood** - Rosewood red, with horses neck and driftwood theme
* **Blumine** - Blumine, easter blue and saffron mango theme

_FlexColorScheme new V4 themes (click image to open hires version)_

Total number of offered built-in color schemes is now **36 matched light
and dark pairs**. By using the swap primary and secondary colors, you can double
the amount of variations with just a boolean toggle. Not all the color
schemes are so attractive when you swap the colors, but some were designed to
support it and look well with the colors reversed too. You can for example use
this to present the dark mode with primary and secondary colors swapped
compared to the light mode.

You can check out this Tweet and its thread
[here](https://twitter.com/RydMike/status/1459984929631215618) to see a visual
presentation of FlexColorScheme's features.

# Quick Start Guide

The quickest way to try FlexColorScheme V4 is to build the
default example application and use it as a hot reload playground to get to
know it.

## Default example - Hot Reload Playground

To try the default **example** on a device or simulator,
clone the [repository](https://github.com/rydmike/flex_color_scheme) and
run the example:

```bash
cd example/
flutter run --release
```

The result is a demo app that uses a custom defined color scheme, 
has a theme mode switch, includes theme colors presentation 
and Material widget samples. With these you can see the active color scheme's 
colors and the created theme's impact on common Material UI widgets.

The default sample app, the **Hot Reload Playground**, looks like this:

[<img src="https://rydmike.com/assets_fcsv4/00_playground_default.jpg?raw=true" alt="playground_default"/>](
https://rydmike.com/assets_fcsv4/00_playground_default.png?raw=true)   
_Hot Reload Playground the Default Example App (click image to open hires version)_ 

It comes fully loaded with template settings and thorough 
comments that explain what to change to produce different results. You
could for example change the `_useScheme` to `true`, as shown below and hot 
reload it, to then use the new `FlexScheme.blueWhale` theme instead.

```dart
// To use a pre-defined color scheme, don't assign any FlexSchemeColor to
// `colors`, instead pick a FlexScheme and assign it to the `scheme` property.
// Try eg the new "Blue Whale" color scheme.
const FlexScheme _scheme = FlexScheme.blueWhale;

// To make it easy to toggle between using the above custom colors, or the
// selected predefined scheme in this example, set _useScheme to true to use the
// selected predefined scheme above, change to false to use the custom colors.
const bool _useScheme = true;
```

There are many settings you can play with in the default
example application. The above selected **blue whale** theme is the first one
shown in the image below. 

[<img src="https://rydmike.com/assets_fcsv4/01_playground_options.jpg?raw=true" alt="options"/>](
https://rydmike.com/assets_fcsv4/01_playground_options.png?raw=true)   
_Hot Reload Playground (click image to open hires version)_

The other results shown above were also produced by editing a few 
properties in this hot reload playground.

In the hot reload playground the side menu has no real functionality, it is 
mainly there to present more surface area using the theme colorscheme background
color. The theme toggle in the menu does work though.

## Themes Playground

The side menu in the default example is actually made for and used
in the last example 5 in the tutorial. The final example 
doubles as an interactive **Themes Playground** application. There the
menu options actually have their indicated functionality. 

The **Themes Playground** is useful as a tool to find themes and settings you 
prefer, or just use it to figure out what you can do with 
FlexColorScheme. The playground persists all its settings, and you can 
reset them back to their default values. It can even generate the Flutter 
FlxColorScheme setup code needed to produce the shown active theme. 

The **Themes Playground** can be used as a [web app 
here](https://rydmike.com/flexcolorschemeV4Tut5). Its source code
is also available in the example sub folder in folder 
[/example5](https://github.com/rydmike/flex_color_scheme/tree/master/example/lib/example5).

It is recommended to go through the tutorial further below to get introduced to
all features step by step. However, feel free to go straight for example 5 if
your really like to dive into the deep end. It is a bit more advanced example
than those generally bundled with packages, but not that complicated.

The **Themes Playground** web app is best experienced at as high resolution as 
possible, preferably even 4k. It is responsive and works splendidly down to 
phone sizes too. It is however easier to see and experience what each 
configuration option in FlexColorScheme does, when you use a large screen 
with high resolution, because then you can see the result of all settings at 
one glance.

[<img src="https://rydmike.com/assets_fcsv4/05-web-demo-4k.jpg?raw=true" alt="playground-4k"/>](
https://rydmike.com/assets_fcsv4/05-web-demo-4k.png?raw=true)  
_FlexColorScheme **Themes Playground** app at 4k resolution (click image to open hires version)_

With the Themes Playground you can also copy any built-in color scheme to a
customizable color scheme, that you can modify by clicking
on the four main scheme colors in the custom scheme. The Themes Playground
can also generate FlexColorScheme setup code that will create the same
color scheme and theme that you are looking. All you have to do is copy the
code and paste it into your app. You can find an example in this
[tweet and referenced thread](https://twitter.com/RydMike/status/1461381878494150659)

## Installing and Using

In the `pubspec.yaml` of your **Flutter** project, add the following dependency:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flex_color_scheme: ^4.2.0
```

In your library file add the following import:

```dart
import 'package:flex_color_scheme/flex_color_scheme.dart';
```

You can now start using `FlexColorScheme` V4 based color schemes and theming 
in your application. A quick way to do so is to try one of the 36 built-in 
color schemes. The schemes have enums that you can use to refer to them with. 

Please study the default example for a thorough guide on how to use almost
**all** properties in FlexColorScheme. To try it on your own from scratch,
create a default Flutter counter app. Add the FlexColorScheme import and modify 
one line of code and add two lines as shown below.

Here we use the  **"Oh Mandy red"** color scheme that is represented by `enum` 
value `FlexScheme.mandyRed`. We set the `MaterialApp.themeMode` to 
`ThemeMode.system`, so that the device can control if the app uses its light 
or dark theme mode, based on the device theme mode system setting. You can 
toggle theme mode by changing theme mode on the device.

Assign `FlexThemeData.light` to the app's `theme`, which is the application's 
light theme definition property, and `FlexThemeData.dark` to `darkTheme`.
For both `FlexThemeData` dark and light we set the `scheme` property to 
`FlexScheme.mandyRed` to use the "Oh Mandy red" predefined `scheme` colors, and 
get matching light and dark themes based on the scheme's color definitions.

The three line modified `MaterialApp` of the Flutter default counter app 
becomes:

```dart
  class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
    @override
    Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Flutter Demo',
      // The Mandy red, light theme.
      theme: FlexThemeData.light(scheme: FlexScheme.mandyRed),
      // The Mandy red, dark theme.
      darkTheme: FlexThemeData.dark(scheme: FlexScheme.mandyRed),
      // Use dark or light theme based on system setting.
      themeMode: ThemeMode.system,
      home: MyHomePage(title: 'Flutter Demo Home Page'),
    );
```

> **New in version 4:**  
> The `FlexThemeData.light` and `FlexThemeData.dark` APIs are new in 
> version 4. They are extensions on `ThemeData` that create 
> `FlexColorScheme.light` and `FlexColorScheme.dark` objects and call their
> `toTheme` method in one step. The new syntax is shorter and also look very
> similar to `ThemeData.light` and `ThemeData.dark` factories. 
> 
> The old APIs work as before and will not be deprecated, they implement
> the actual functionality and are also needed in more advanced theming use 
> cases. They can for example be useful and preferred when you add your own 
> custom widget sub-themes to FlexColorScheme themes. With FlexColorScheme
> you can then extract the `ColorScheme` it will use for its ThemeData. You 
> often need the colors in this `ColorSchene` when you create widget sub-themes
> that use matching colors.

The above additions gives us the following look on the familiar counter app:

<img src="https://rydmike.com/assets_fcsv4/fcs_counter_app.png?raw=true" alt="counter sample" width="500"/>

_FlexColorScheme applied on the standard Flutter Counter Template_


Not as exciting as the earlier images above. That is because the basic counter app 
uses very few features and widgets, so it cannot really illustrate the result very 
well. This is why the included examples contain demo UI, that is not really at 
all relevant to using FlexColorScheme, it is mainly there to be able to
properly demonstrate the results.

# All Color Schemes

Color schemes are not fun without some built-in schemes ready to try and use.
**FlexColorScheme** comes bundled with **36** ready to go matching light
and dark color schemes. You you can use them in your applications if you like.
Here is a grid showing all the color schemes in light and dark mode. You
can click on them to open a high resolution version of each image.

_All available color schemes (click to open a hires version of each image)_

In the [**scheme reference**](#scheme-reference) you can find a table listing
all the built-in color schemes with their `FlexScheme` enum value, name and
description.

Another convenient and recommended way to see and try all the predefined color
schemes is by using the Web versions of the package
[example 4 "All Themes"](https://rydmike.com/flexcolorschemeV4Tut4) and of course
[example 5 "Themes Playground"](https://rydmike.com/flexcolorschemeV4Tut5) is
the ultimate showcase of all the built-in color schemes.
Using it you can try all the built-in color schemes with theming options, 
and see the impact they have on often used Flutter UI widgets.

## Built-in Color Scheme Designs

The built-in color schemes are all tuned matching light and dark scheme pairs.
Most of them are pretty conservative, but some are intentionally a bit more
playful and bold. The first two color schemes are actually the Flutter and
Material 2 Design Guide examples of light and dark color schemes, and the Flutter
high contrast light and dark color versions as well. So OK, there are actually
"only" 34 new and different from standard Flutter ready-made light and dark
color scheme pairs. The color scheme "Amber blue" is also a high-contrast theme.
An alternative to the built-in Material high contrast theme.

The built-in schemes do not claim to be a "this selection" fits all needs
collection. Nor do they claim to be more correct than any other color scheme.
What fits your needs and looks good to you, is the right choice for your
application and use case.

You can make your own custom scheme totally from scratch, or use the built-in
ones as a starting point and inspiration. You can re-use colors from existing 
schemes, via their const `FlexColor` name. All the color values in the color 
schemes are available as const values, so you can easily make new custom
combinations using existing color schemes and add a few custom ones to the mix.

## Use Your Own Color Schemes with FlexColorScheme

The package examples show how you can easily make and use your own custom
color schemes with FlexColorScheme. Maybe the built-in examples will inspire
your creative side to define your own schemes. The tutorial walks you through
how to define your own color schemes and make themes based on them.

You can create your own custom list of schemes, then use this list with
only your own custom color schemes selection. You may also append some, or
even all the built-in schemes after your custom schemes, and give your
users a lot of theme options. How to do this is demonstrated in the tutorial
in examples 4 and 5.

Where did the built-in color schemes come from? While building, testing and 
using this package over a long period of time, a number
of color schemes were born as a side product. I decided to include them in
FlexColorscheme and offer them for re-use and inspiration as they are. It is
however not necessary to use them to reap the benefits of FlexColorScheme.

The color and scheme definitions for the built-in color schemes are in their
own class. They will not be included in the release compiled version of your
application if you do not use (reference) them in your application, and instead
only use your own custom color schemes for the themes.

# Example Applications

FlexColorScheme comes bundled with six different examples. Earlier we 
saw how you can build the default example, and use it as a
"Hot Reload Playground". You can use it to experiment and learn on your own 
about FlexColorScheme's features and how to use them.

The default example is a template that is heavily commented to guide
you and encourage you to play around with different options in code, then use
Flutter's hot reload feature and see the results at once.

The other five examples are a part of a tutorial path, with increasing complexity,
that we walk through in the tutorial. It ends with the complete
**Themes Playground** demo app included as example 5.

## Building the Examples

You can build the examples by using preconfigured launch and run config files for
VS-Code (.vscode -> launch.json) and Android Studio/IntelliJ
(.run -> *.xml files). 

When you have cloned the package repo and open the
project in VS-Code or Android Studio/IntelliJ the configurations should be
available for you, so you can easily build all the examples.

In IntelliJ and Android Studio you can use:  
<img src="https://rydmike.com/assets_fcsv4/intelliJ-run-file.png?raw=true" alt="intellij-run"/>  

_For IntelliJ and Studio there is a .run config that can be used to build and run the examples_

In VS-Code you can use:  
<img src="https://rydmike.com/assets_fcsv4/vscode-run-file.png?raw=true" alt="vscode-run"/>  

_For VS-Code there is a launch.json that can be used to build and run the examples_


## Live WEB Demos of the Examples

If you want to take a quick look at all the examples, you can try live web
versions of them.

[**Example 1**](https://rydmike.com/flexcolorschemeV4Tut1) represents the simplest
use case. To use one of the built-in color schemes as your application theme.
You can toggle between its light and dark variant, or allow device system theme
mode setting to control if the dark or light theme is used.

[<img src="https://rydmike.com/assets_fcsv4/21-example-1-a-small.jpg?raw=true" alt="ColorScheme example 1"/>](https://rydmike.com/assets_fcsv4/21-example-1-a.png?raw=true)   
_Example 1) Using a built-in FlexColorScheme color scheme as application
theme (click image to open hires version)_

[**Example 2**](https://rydmike.com/flexcolorschemeV4Tut2) is like example 1,
but we use custom colors to make a custom color scheme and turn it into a theme.
The architecture is also more advanced, it uses the approach introduced with
Flutter skeleton template, using a theme service and theme controller.
Here we keep settings only in memory using the in memory `ThemeServiceMem`
theme service.

[<img src="https://rydmike.com/assets_fcsv4/22-example-2-a-small.jpg?raw=true" alt="ColorScheme example 2" />](https://rydmike.com/assets_fcsv4/22-example-2-a.png?raw=true)   
_Example 2) Using custom colors with FlexColorScheme color scheme as
application theme (click image to open hires version)_

[**In example 3**](https://rydmike.com/flexcolorschemeV4Tut3) we can toggle the
active theme between 3 different predefined color schemes, plus the custom one
we defined in example 2. We can also opt in and out of using the new sub theming.

All the settings are persisted locally, using a theme service 
called `ThemeServicePrefs`. This service uses the package
[SharedPreferences](https://pub.dev/packages/shared_preferences) to persist
the theme settings locally as they are modified.

[<img src="https://rydmike.com/assets_fcsv4/23-example-3-a-small.jpg?raw=true" alt="ColorScheme example 3" />](https://rydmike.com/assets_fcsv4/23-example-3-a.png?raw=true)  
_Example 3) Using three built-in schemes, plus a custom color scheme
as application theme options (click image to open hires version)_

[**In example 4**](https://rydmike.com/flexcolorschemeV4Tut4) we can select any
of the different built-in color schemes plus three custom ones, and
use them as the application theme. In this example we persist the theme
settings using a theme service called `ThemeServiceHive`. It persists the 
settings locally using a package called [Hive](https://pub.dev/packages/hive). 

[<img src="https://rydmike.com/assets_fcsv4/24-example-4-a-small.jpg?raw=true" alt="ColorScheme example 4" />](https://rydmike.com/assets_fcsv4/24-example-4-a.png?raw=true)   
_Example 4) Using custom schemes, plus all the built-in ones as application
theme options (click image to open hires version)_

[**Example 5**](https://rydmike.com/flexcolorschemeV4Tut5) is the last, and most
complex of the examples. It presents most configuration and
settings available in FlexColorScheme. You can modify them interactively
and the application changes theme as you modify any setting.

In this example we also persist the theme settings as you change any value
and parameter in the app. This is done using the same theme service 
`ThemeServiceHive` that was used in example 4. The settings can also be reset 
back to their default values.

This example is best seen and tested on a tablet, desktop or desktop web browser,
rather than on a phone. The app certainly works well on a phone sized 
canvas too, it is using a **very** responsive design. It is just difficult to 
get a good overview of all the settings possibilities and their impact on different,
widgets, while changing the settings on the small phone UI, since you cannot see
everything at the same time as you change property values.

_Example 5) The Themes Playground (click image to open hires version)_


[**Flexfold demo**](https://rydmike.com/demoflexfold)

Another classic example of **FlexColorScheme** usage can be seen in the Flutter
web [**Flexfold demo app**](https://rydmike.com/demoflexfold).

<img src="https://rydmike.com/assets/FoldTheme1.gif?raw=true" alt="Flexfold demo"/>

_Flexfold Demo uses FlexColorScheme for its themes._

The live version of the Flexfold demo is still using FlexColorScheme version 3.
Example 5, the **Themes Playground**, has more theming features
than the Flexfold demo.

# Flutter Theming Introduction

When you make themed Flutter applications you should base the colors of your 
application on a light theme mode suitable `ColorScheme`, and a dark theme mode 
`ColorScheme`. Then create your light and dark `ThemeData` using these color 
schemes, by assigning the `ColorScheme` for each mode to the `colorScheme` 
property in `ThemeData`. In your `MaterialApp` you then assign the `ThemeData` 
for your light, and dark theme to the `theme` and `darkTheme` properties 
in the `MaterialApp`. 

This gives you an application that uses the defined color schemes on all the 
Flutter SDK built-in Material UI widgets. Well, on most of them anyway. 
Flutter's `ThemeData.from` a `ColorScheme` has a few gaps. The used color scheme
is not consistently applied on all built-in Flutter SDK Material UI Widgets. 
To get it really right, you also have to assign the colors from your
`ColorScheme` to a number of color properties that still  
exist as direct properties in `ThemeData`. 

## Flutter ThemeData

At its core, `FlexColorScheme.toTheme` creates a `ThemeData` object. It helps 
you make a color scheme based, consistent and a more refined 
Flutter `ThemeData` object. 

The Flutter `ThemeData` object is a very large theme property data, 
and theme behaviour controlling class. It can change the look and feel of Flutter
applications completely. It is not really that difficult to use, but it has many
quirks and oddities, especially when it comes to used colors. This is mostly
due to past legacy and things that were not considered early on. Some parts were
done differently first, later things changed, but those earlier ways are 
still supported to not break past behavior, together with some newer ways to 
define and setup colors. 

This is all further complicated by the fact that 
under the hood many Flutter SDK UI widgets still use the original direct color 
properties in `ThemeData`. These properties are now mostly assigned color 
values via `ThemeData.colorScheme`. Exactly how depends on which
`ThemeData` factory constructor you use.

Many older widgets still do not use the `ThemeData.colorScheme` properties for 
their default color values directly, they still use color property values in
`ThemeData`, that got assigned values from `ThemeData.colorScheme`, that varies
depending on used `ThemeData` factory! Still with me?
Very basic and old widgets, like for example `Material` and `Card` fall into 
this category.
While some newer widgets actually do use colors from `ThemeData.colorScheme` 
directly. Additionally, the colors in the
`ColorScheme` held by the `colorScheme` property in `ThemeData` can actually not
represent all the colors that exist in `ThemeData`'s color properties. Thus, some 
of those color properties never get any `ColorScheme` based values assigned to 
them. They are left to default values assigned by the `ThemeData` factory, 
unless you explicitly assign them some color that fits with your color scheme.
If this is not done, it can then look odd when some widgets use the factory 
default colors, while the rest of your app's widgets correctly use the 
`ColorScheme` based colors. Luckily there are not so many widgets left that this
still applies to, but there are a few, for example `CircleAvatar`.

It can all be very confusing and frustrating to fight with ThemeData and its
colors, and if not done properly, it may result in themes with color schemes 
that are not entirely consistent or logical across all standard SDK 
widgets in your application.

One of the fundamental things FlexColorScheme does, is that it fixes these minor
inconsistencies and gaps that exist with Flutter's `ThemeData.from` factory
and handles the complexity of using the `ThemeData` factory directly. It 
releases you from the burden of knowing what colors in it affects which widgets
how.

FlexColorScheme makes a few opinionated, but subtle theme modifications compared
to the `ThemeData.from` themes created from a `ColorScheme`. By default,
FlexColorScheme theming refrains from touching theme properties not related 
to making the colors more consistent. Some minor adjustments were however 
needed. This is covered in detail in the external
[inside FlexColorScheme document (external link)](https://github.com/rydmike/flex_color_scheme/blob/master/INSIDE.md).

There is a Flutter development plan to deprecate most, if not all, of the direct 
color properties in the `ThemeData` class. Flutter SDK Widgets should after that 
only use `ColorSceheme` based colors that are in the ThemeData `colorScheme` 
property, as the default colors for their designs. This design 
[document](https://flutter.dev/go/material-theme-system-updates)
describes the plan and reasoning. There is also a color property deprecation 
check list [issue 91772](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/91772) to 
mirror this plan. 

For FlexColorScheme the progress of these actions are monitored 
closely. Needed changes and updates in FlexColorScheme will be implemented when  
related changes in ThemeData reach the Flutter stable channel. FlexColorScheme
already of course correctly defines a `ColorScheme` for `ThemeData`. The
typical maintenance need is removing deprecated `ThemeData` properties and check
if some new sub-theme color property needs to be modified to replicate past
FlexColorScheme theming behaviour, when its corresponding color property is 
removed from `ThemeData`.

## Color Blended Surfaces

The Material 2 Guide briefly mentions
[color branded and blended surfaces](https://material.io/design/color/dark-theme.html#properties). 
In the new version of Material Design called [Material You and now also known as
Material 3](https://m3.material.io/), color branded or blended and also
just colored surfaces, are used extensively. It is done in more flexible ways 
than what can be done with theming alone in current version of Flutter. We look 
forward to seeing these features soon in Flutter as well. 

With **FlexColorScheme** you can already with current version of Flutter SDK
easily create fancy looking primary color branded
and alpha blended themes. These themes work natively with the current Material
2 design based themes and all UI widgets in the current version of Flutter.

The themes are created by using different blend modes and blend level strengths,
for blending in primary color into surface and background colors. This can bring
different and new nuances to your application. Below an example of the 
same theme, but using different blend modes and levels. The effect can be kept  
very subtle or made very bold and impactful.

The first light and dark image pair show the theme using blend level 0. 
At level 0 there are no alpha blends of primary color in any surfaces, so all 
modes look the same. The next six images use the same blend level strength 18, 
but show six different blend modes. Next, one of the modes is repeated, 
but at blend level 33. Last the theme that was used to generate all these 
different nuances of the same color scheme based theme, is shown.

[<img src="https://rydmike.com/assets_fcsv4/06-blend-examples.jpg?raw=true" alt="blend examples"/>](
https://rydmike.com/assets_fcsv4/06-blend-examples.png?raw=true)   
_FlexColorScheme using same theme, but with
different blend modes and levels (click image to open hires version)_

There are **9 different blend modes at 40 different levels each**, that you can
choose from, to tune a theme to your liking. You don't have to use the 
same blend mode or level for your light and dark theme mode, the included 
examples only do so to keep the interactive examples simpler. Often a 
different blend mode and level for your light and dark themes, may produce
a more balanced or more impactful result, depending on your design goal.

The above images were made with the **Themes Playground** (example 5) app 
running as a phone app, instead of using the 
[web demo](https://rydmike.com/flexcolorschemeV4Tut5).
The application is open source, and is included as the last example in the 
pub.dev bundled examples and on 
[GitHub here](https://github.com/rydmike/flex_color_scheme/tree/master/example/lib/example5).
The **Themes Playground** is an interesting and useful tool when you want to 
find fitting themes, blend modes and levels to use as your application's 
FlexColorScheme based theme. It even allows you to copy/paste the code needed
to make the Flutter theme you are looking at.

# Frequently Asked Questions

Below some frequently asked question and answers about using FlexColorScheme.

## Custom color schemes?

A `FlexColorScheme` based theme, can like Flutter's standard `ColorScheme` 
based theme be created by specifying all the required color scheme colors. 
However, with `FlexColorScheme` 
you can also specify only the primary color and get all other colors needed 
for a complete color scheme computed based the given primary color.

There is a helper class `FlexSchemeColor`, with a factory called 
`FlexSchemeColor.from`, it can create complete color schemes from 
incomplete color scheme data. Additionally, its `toDark` method can create a 
computed matching dark scheme from a defined light scheme. 

These features are useful when you quickly want to test a single color, or maybe 
only a primary and secondary color for a light theme, and get all other scheme 
colors computed. When you figure out the colors you want, you can use exactly
tuned color definitions and make your custom color schemes from const values
instead. Using different ways to create custom color schemes is presented in 
detail in the tutorial examples 2, 3 and 4.

And you can also use the live version of example 5, the 
[Themes Playground](https://rydmike.com/flexcolorschemeV4Tut5) to copy 
existing color schemes and modify them 
interactively and copy the code for a theme, either custom one or all
the setups you made for a built-in one.

## Can I add custom sub themes?

When you make a theme with `FlexThemeData.light` or `dark`, it returns a normal
Flutter `ThemeData` object that you can use like any other `ThemeData` object. 
You can then use this returned `ThemeData` and add 
additional custom sub theming to it with `ThemeData`'s normal `copyWith` method, 
before passing it on to your application's `theme` or `darkTheme` properties.

If you need color values that `FlexColorScheme` has created, maybe some auto 
calculated main colors, but more typically the blended surface and on surface 
colors for your sub themes, you can get them too. For this advanced use case, 
it is recommended to use FlexColorScheme with the factory constructor 
`FlexColorScheme.light` and `FlexColorScheme.dark`, to create the
`FlexColorScheme` objects first. Then get the `ColorScheme` they define 
with its `toScheme` method, and use this `ColorScheme` data as input to your
custom sub theme creation. 

When you make sub themes, you often need access to the colors their main
`ThemeData` is using and storing in its `colorScheme` property. This step
gives you that before even creating the `ThemeData` object from your 
FlexColorScheme object. You can then Pass the `ColorScheme` you got 
from `toScheme`, or just one or some of its 
color values, along to your methods that define your sub theme data. 

Using these steps you can turn your FlexColorScheme to `ThemeData` with its 
`toTheme` method, and then add your sub themes with `copyWith` to this 
object in the same go, since they now use the same `ColorScheme` colors, that 
the ThemeData created with `toTheme` will get as as well.

You can of course also create the FlexColorScheme `ThemeData` with the 
extensions `FlexThemeData.light` and `dark`, and get the `ColorScheme` 
object from the ThemeData `colorScheme` property. Then use that color 
scheme to create your sub-themes that need access to those color values.
Finally, use `copyWith` to create a new `ThemeData` with your custom sub themes 
included. This is however one extra step and additional ThemeData object
compared to the other approach.

If you are creating modifications to a sub-theme that FlexColorScheme already
defines, **and** you want to keep the properties it has assigned. For example 
only override a few property values in such a sub theme, then you will indeed 
need to first create the `FlexColorScheme` based `ThemeData` object. Use the 
sub theme from it that you want to add a modified copy of, as input to the
new `ThemeData`. In such a case you might as well use `FlexThemeData.light` 
and `dark` API, since there is no win in the steps by first creating 
the `FlexColorScheme` object. 

If you are not opting in on the opinionated sub themes, this applies to the 
following sub themes that are not null even in the vanilla FlexColorScheme 
based `ThemeData`:

- `ThemeData.appBarTheme`
- `ThemeData.bottomAppBarTheme`
- `ThemeData.tabBarTheme`
- `ThemeData.inputDecorationTheme`
- `ThemeData.textSelectionTheme`
- `ThemeData.tooltipTheme`
- `ThemeData.buttonTheme` (for the legacy deprecated buttons)
- `ThemeData.chipTheme`
- `ThemeData.bottomNavigationBarTheme`

The changes made in the above vanilla FlexColorScheme based `ThemeData` 
sub themes are pretty small, but the themes are not null. You can read more
about what changes `FlexColorScheme` makes to them in this
["Inside FlexColorScheme" document (external link)](https://github.com/rydmike/flex_color_scheme/blob/master/INSIDE.md).

When you opt in on using the opinionated sub themes in version 4, the above 
sub themes are typically further modified. Additionally, the following sub 
themes are also no longer null, which they are in the vanilla version:

- `ThemeData.iconTheme`
- `ThemeData.primaryIconTheme`
- `ThemeData.textButtonTheme`
- `ThemeData.elevatedButtonTheme`
- `ThemeData.outlinedButtonTheme`
- `ThemeData.toggleButtonsTheme`
- `ThemeData.floatingActionButtonTheme`
- `ThemeData.cardTheme`
- `ThemeData.popupMenuTheme`
- `ThemeData.dialogTheme`
- `ThemeData.timePickerTheme`
- `ThemeData.snackBarTheme`
- `ThemeData.bottomSheetTheme`
- `ThemeData.navigationBarTheme`

If you want to add custom sub-themes and keep the already existing modified
properties in `ThemeData` intact, you cannot use just a `copyWith` using
a sub theme constructor. You have to use the sub-theme instance from
the current `ThemeData`, and the `copyWith` on it, assign it to the sub theme
in the `copyWith` on the `ThemeData`. This is the same way that you
would modify `ThemeData` when you create scoped ThemeData inside your
app, and want it to fully inherit the parent Theme, but with a few 
properties modified in some sub themes only. This sounds more complicated
than it is.

To make it easier to follow, here is an example of what this looks like.
Say you want to modify shadow color of the `appBarTheme` in `ThemeData`, 
but you also want to keep all the other theme changes FlexColorScheme has 
introduced to it, like e.g. using surface color with a blend of primary as 
its background color, if you have chosen that mode for the `AppBar` theme.
You can then add your shadow color like this:


```dart
class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
    @override
    Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    final ThemeData lightTheme = FlexThemeData.light(scheme: FlexScheme.mandyRed);
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Flutter Demo',
      theme: lightTheme.copyWith(appBarTheme: lightTheme.appBarTheme.copyWith(
           shadowColor: const Color(0xFFFFFFFF));
      themeMode: ThemeMode.light,
      home: MyHomePage(title: 'Flutter Demo Home Page'),
    );
  }
}
```

This is still a bit involved. I might look into the possibility of providing
deepCopyWith methods, at least for the first sub theme level, in a 
future version. Some kind of `deepCopyWith` method for sub-themes would be 
really handy to even have in the Flutter SDK on `ThemeData`.

One additional possibility when creating totally custom sub-themes is to utilize the
static helper functions in the `FlexSubThemes` class. FlexColorScheme uses 
them internally to create the sub themes in version 4.
You can find its API documentation [here](https://pub.dev/documentation/flex_color_scheme/latest/flex_color_scheme/FlexSubThemes-class.html).
Some of them offer simplified APIs for setting and using more involved features 
in its standard SDK sub-theme. You can also use them to check out
how a particular design is implemented if you want to replicate it in a standard 
Flutter SDK sub-theme.

You can of course also use these sub theming functions to make custom 
sub-themes, and even complement them with `copyWith` values for properties 
they do not provide. Please note 
that the `FlexSubThemes` static helper functions are not meant to provide 
all properties for all existing sub themes. They only cover the properties 
and shortcut features needed by `FlexColorScheme`. When using `FlexColorScheme` 
you typically use the `FlexSubThemesData` configuration class, passed in to 
`FlexColorScheme.subThemesData` property, as a convenient way to configure 
and customize them in one go.


## If I don't use the predefined Schemes, why should I use FlexColorScheme?

The purposes with the FlexColorScheme package is to: 

* Fixes some odd things in Flutter's standard ThemeData definitions and make 
  all SDK Widgets, old, new and even deprecated ones, use the specified color
  scheme in the expected way.
* Enable easy switching among multiple color schemes in an app. 
* Provide an easy way to make themes with primary color branded and blended 
  backgrounds and surfaces. Be able to easily vary the blend level and mode
  for different surfaces. 
* Provide a quick toggle for different `AppBar` styles, without the need to 
  manually make a custom theme for it every time, including matching `TabBar`. 
* Provide optional support for a true black mode for dark themes.
* Quickly swap the primary and secondary color definitions, if you 
  want to try your theme the other way around.
* Theme the Android System navigation bar to match your app theme, and make it 
  partially or totally transparent.
* With default settings FlexColorScheme avoids touching the Widget sub-theme
  definitions, but in a few cases it is needed to fix things and to make some
  minor design changes. In the default produced ThemeData the changes are as few
  and subtle as possible, leaving the task of Widget sub theming more up to you. 
  However, you can also opt in on widget sub themes to get a more refined and 
  opinionated look on widgets and used text theme. The defaults for
  the new opt in sub themes are inspired by the new 
  [Material 3 guide](https://m3.material.io/). Following it when it can easily
  be accomplished by using the Material 2 based theming in Flutter. Full 
  support for Material 3 widgets and themes is coming to Flutter later.
* FlexColorScheme also provides a way to make "lazy" quick toned `ColorScheme` 
  themes from just a single light scheme color. Even its dark scheme
  counterpart can be made from this single color definition. 

If you like the above features, then FlexColorScheme may fit your theming 
requirements, even if you do not use any of its built-in color schemes. 

## Can we change this predefined scheme's colors?

No, current predefined schemes will not be changed. Changing them would be a 
breaking change to the package version promise. The scheme colors could in theory 
be changed by releasing a new major version that break past scheme color 
definitions. At the moment, there are no plans to ever add breaking releases 
to just change a predefined scheme's color(s). All current color definition 
values are also included in the package tests, and a failed color value test is 
considered a breaking design change.

## Can we add this scheme?

To keep things interesting, there will from time to time be new color schemes 
added to the package. If you have a beautiful color scheme with matching light
and dark theme mode colors, that you think would be perfect to include, then 
please post a suggestion as a GitHub issue. 

No promise is made about its eventual inclusion, but if it is a nice, 
unique, and overall a pretty color scheme, it will likely be included.
Coming up with nice color schemes is trickier than it seems, 
suggestions and contributions to new ones are very welcome.

## Can I use different built-in color schemes for my light and dark themes?

Yes this is possible. Use different `FlexScheme` enum values for the light 
and dark `FlexThemeData.light` and `FlexThemeData.dark` factories' `scheme` 
property. If the colors used by the selected schemes are a bit related, this
can be used to create nice and unique light and dark combinations of 
the predefined schemes.

By using the `colors` property you could even apply a `FlexSchemeColor` that 
has data that was designed for a light theme, to the `FlexThemeData.dark` factory,
and wise versa. For example, using the `FlexThemeData.dark` factory, you could
to its `colors` property assign the `FlexSchemeColors` from  
`FlexColor.schemes[FlexScheme.mandyRed].light` that are designed and intended 
to be used with the light mode factory.

The results will typically not be very useful or pretty. The rationale for 
the slightly involved data structure, is to keep it flexible, but at the same
time provide self documenting API guidance on how the data was designed to be 
used and consumed. 

The `scheme` property prevents using the light scheme colors for the dark 
factory and wise versa. It can however be done if so desired by using the
`colors` property as explained above. The `colors` property is always needed and
used when you make custom color schemes using the `FlexThemeData.light` and 
`FlexThemeData.dark` factories.

# Tutorial

In this tutorial we go through all the bundled examples and explain the 
used `FlexColorScheme` features in each example.

The key part for each example is always in the used `MaterialApp`, where all the 
FlexColorScheme setup for the themes are made. The rest of the content in the 
examples is mainly there to make a visual presentation of the resulting theme from 
the used color scheme, and to allow you to control the theme settings.

## Example 1 - Basic Theme Usage

The first and simplest example shows how you can use a predefined color scheme
in `FlexColorScheme` to define light and dark themes using the selected scheme.
How to turn it into a theme used by your application, and then switch between 
its light and dark mode themes. A theme showcase widget shows the theme's effect
on several common Material UI widgets.

> The full code is not shown below, only highlights.
> Please find the complete example code
> [here](https://github.com/rydmike/flex_color_scheme/tree/master/example/lib/example1).

 ```dart
void main() => runApp(const DemoApp());

class DemoApp extends StatefulWidget {
  const DemoApp({Key? key}) : super(key: key);

  @override
  _DemoAppState createState() => _DemoAppState();
}

class _DemoAppState extends State<DemoApp> {
  // Used to select if we use the dark or light theme, start with system mode.
  ThemeMode themeMode = ThemeMode.system;

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Select the predefined FlexScheme color scheme to use. Modify the
    // used FlexScheme enum value below to try other pre-made color schemes.
    const FlexScheme usedScheme = FlexScheme.mandyRed;

    return MaterialApp(
      debugShowCheckedModeBanner: false,
      scrollBehavior: AppScrollBehavior(),
      title: 'Basic Theme Usage',
      // Use a predefined FlexThemeData.light() theme for the light theme.
      theme: FlexThemeData.light(
        scheme: usedScheme,
        // Use very subtly themed app bar elevation in light mode.
        appBarElevation: 0.5,
      ),
      // Same definition for the dark theme, but using FlexThemeData.dark().
      darkTheme: FlexThemeData.dark(
        scheme: usedScheme,
        // Use stronger themed app bar elevation in dark mode.
        appBarElevation: 2,
      ),
      // Use the above dark or light theme based on active themeMode.
      themeMode: themeMode,
      home: HomePage(
        // We pass it the current theme mode.
        themeMode: themeMode,
        // On the home page we can toggle theme mode between light and dark.
        onThemeModeChanged: (ThemeMode mode) {
          setState(() {
            themeMode = mode;
          });
        },
        // Pass in the FlexSchemeData we used for the active theme. 
        flexSchemeData: FlexColor.schemes[usedScheme]!,
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

To the `HomePage` we pass in the current value of the `themeMode` and use a 
callback to get back its changed value, we use it to update 
`themeMode` in a standard `setState` to make the app rebuild using
the new value.

We also pass in the `FlexSchemeData` we defined for our custom theme to the
`HomePage`. Not really needed, but we use it on the home page to show the 
active theme's name, description and colors in a theme mode switch.

When you build and run **example 1** you get an application that looks 
like this in light and dark mode:

[<img src="https://rydmike.com/assets_fcsv4/21-example-1-a-small.jpg?raw=true" alt="ColorScheme example 1 light"/>](https://rydmike.com/assets_fcsv4/21-example-1-a.png?raw=true)
[<img src="https://rydmike.com/assets_fcsv4/21-example-1-b-small.jpg?raw=true" alt="ColorScheme example 1 dark"/>](https://rydmike.com/assets_fcsv4/21-example-1-b.png?raw=true)

theme. (click image to open hires version)_

Scroll down in the app to see the theme showcase further below. It presents the
theme with common Material UI widgets. You can try this example as a Flutter
[web app here](https://rydmike.com/flexcolorschemeV4Tut1).

## Example 2 - Custom Theme

This example shows how you can define your own color schemes using
`FlexSchemeColor` and `FlexSchemeData`, to create `FlexColorScheme` based 
application themes from them.

> The full code is not shown below, only highlights. 
> Please find the complete example code
> [here](https://github.com/rydmike/flex_color_scheme/tree/master/example/lib/example2).


In this example, and the ones after it, we use a `ThemeService` and
`ThemeController` to manage our theme settings. This follows the example
architecture you get when you create a Flutter template application
architecture with:

```bash
 > flutter create -t skeleton my_flutter_app
```

This example uses a theme service with only memory storage and no persistence. 
In later examples we use locally persisting theme services. In this example we 
use the theme controller to change the theme mode and to toggle opting in and 
out of FlexColorScheme's opinionated sub-themes.

```dart
Future<void> main() async {
  WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();
  // This used theme service.
  final ThemeService themeService = ThemeServiceMem();
  // Initialize the theme service.
  await themeService.init();
  // Create a ThemeController that uses the ThemeService. 
  final ThemeController themeController = ThemeController(themeService);
  // Load all the preferred theme settings, while the app is loading, before 
  // MaterialApp is created. This prevents a sudden theme change when the app 
  // is first displayed.
  await themeController.loadAll();
  // Run the app and pass in the ThemeController. The app listens to the
  // ThemeController for changes.
  runApp(DemoApp(themeController: themeController));
}
```

To make a custom color scheme, we for simplicity define it as a local 
constant in this example. We make a `FlexSchemeData` object with a name, 
description and `FlexSchemeColor` scheme colors defined for the light and 
matching dark scheme. 

```dart
const FlexSchemeData _myFlexScheme = FlexSchemeData(
  name: 'Midnight blue',
  description: 'Midnight blue theme, custom definition of all colors',
  light: FlexSchemeColor(
    primary: Color(0xFF00296B),
    primaryVariant: Color(0xFF2F5C91),
    secondary: Color(0xFFFF7B00),
    secondaryVariant: Color(0xFFFDB100),
  ),
  dark: FlexSchemeColor(
    primary: Color(0xFF6B8BC3),
    primaryVariant: Color(0xFF4874AA),
    secondary: Color(0xffff7155),
    secondaryVariant: Color(0xFFF1CB9D),
  ),
);
```

We could also have stored the light and dark scheme only in their own 
`FlexSchemeColor` objects, and added them directly in their respective
`colors` property in `FlexThemeData.light` and `FlexThemeData.dark`. 
However, we will also use this information on the `HomePage` for the 
theme switch widget and to display the scheme name and description. 
Putting them in a `FlexSchemeData` object that bundles the light and 
dark scheme color `FlexSchemeColor`, plus a name and description, is a 
convenient way to pass it along and re-use the information on the home page.

We use the `FlexSchemeData` instance `_myFlexScheme` instance `light` and `dark` 
properties, as `colors` value for our `FlexThemeData.light` and 
`FlexThemeData.dark`, that we then assign to the `MaterialApp` light theme 
property `theme` and `darkTheme` property respectively.

The setup is similar to how we used one of the built-in predefined
`FlexSchemeData` objects in example 1 via its enum selection property, 
but in this case we defined our own custom `FlexSchemeData` in `_myFlexScheme`
and used the `colors` property in `FlexSchemeData` to tell it to use those 
colors instead of a built-in scheme.

We glue the `ThemeController` to the MaterialApp. The Flutter standard 
`AnimatedBuilder` Widget listens to the `ThemeController` for changes.

The Flutter `AnimatedBuilder` is a bit oddly named for this use case. Here 
it serves the purpose of functioning as a "`ChangeNotifierBuilder`", 
that rebuilds its child when its `Listenable`, the `animation` changes.
Which it does whenever our `ThemeController` calls `notifyListeners`.
Which we do in the `ThemeController` class when we have new updated data
that requires the theme to update.

This results in that whenever you update any theme settings managed by
the `ThemeController`, the `MaterialApp` is rebuilt with the new setting
becoming effective. It rebuilds the entire app UI when any value in 
the `ThemeController` trigger a change via a `notifyListeners` call. 
This is fine though, since all property changes in it are of the 
nature that the entire App UI needs to be redrawn anyway, so this approach 
works well for this use case.

```dart
class DemoApp extends StatelessWidget {
  const DemoApp({Key? key, required this.themeController}) : super(key: key);
  final ThemeController themeController;

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {

    return AnimatedBuilder(
      animation: themeController,
      builder: (BuildContext context, Widget? child) {
        return MaterialApp(
          debugShowCheckedModeBanner: false,
          scrollBehavior: AppScrollBehavior(),
          title: 'Custom Theme',
          // Define FlexThemeData.light() theme using above custom colors.
          theme: FlexThemeData.light(
            colors: _myFlexScheme.light,
            // Opt in/out on FlexColorScheme sub-themes with theme controller.
            useSubThemes: themeController.useSubThemes,
            // Use  very low elevation light theme mode. On light colored
            // AppBars this show up as a nice thin underline effect.
            appBarElevation: 0.5,
            // Here we want the large default visual density on all platforms.
            visualDensity: VisualDensity.standard,
            // Use a custom font, Noto Sans in this case.
            fontFamily: GoogleFonts.notoSans().fontFamily,
          ),
          // Same setup for the dark theme, but using FlexThemeData.dark().
          darkTheme: FlexThemeData.dark(
            colors: _myFlexScheme.dark,
            useSubThemes: themeController.useSubThemes,
            appBarElevation: 1,
            visualDensity: VisualDensity.standard,
            fontFamily: GoogleFonts.notoSans().fontFamily,
          ),
          // Use the dark or light theme, based on theme controller setting.
          themeMode: themeController.themeMode,
          home: HomePage(
            flexSchemeData: _myFlexScheme,
            // Pass in the theme controller to the home page.
            controller: themeController,
          ),
        );
      });
  }
}
```

> As shown above, you can add a font via just a `fontFamily` from GoogleFonts.
For better and more fine controlled results, prefer defining complete 
`TextThemes,` using a font and its different styles, you can then even use
more than one font for your text theme. Then assign the `TextTheme` to 
the `textTheme` and `primaryTextTheme` properties in `FlexThemeData`. 
This is how you would use do it with standard `ThemeData` too.

The `themeController` is also passed to the `HomePage` where we use it in UI
widgets to change the theme mode, and to opt in and out of using the sub themes
feature in FlexColorScheme.

When you build and run **example 2** you get a sample application that looks 
like this in light and dark mode:
[<img src="https://rydmike.com/assets_fcsv4/22-example-2-a-small.jpg?raw=true" alt="ColorScheme example 2 light" />](https://rydmike.com/assets_fcsv4/22-example-2-a.png?raw=true)

_Example 2) Using custom colors with FlexColorScheme color scheme as
application theme (click image to open hires version)_

Scroll down in the app to see the theme showcase further below. It presents the
theme with common Material UI widgets. You can try this example as a Flutter
[web app here](https://rydmike.com/flexcolorschemeV4Tut2).


## Example 3 - Four Themes

This example shows how you can use three built-in color schemes, add a custom 
scheme, using the same colors as in example 2. We use these four color schemes 
as selectable `FlexColorScheme` based theme options. The example also uses surface 
colors with primary color blends.

> The full code is not shown below, only highlights.
> Please find the complete example code
> [here](https://github.com/rydmike/flex_color_scheme/tree/master/example/lib/example3).

The `main` start function of the app is very similar to example 2, but in this
case we use another `ThemeService` implementation, the `ThemeServicePrefs`
version, that will locally persist the theme selection options we make.

The `ThemeServicePrefs` persistence is based on the popular package
[SharedPreferences](https://pub.dev/packages/shared_preferences).

```dart
Future<void> main() async {
  WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();
  // Here we can use Shared Preferences. The examples are all built using same
  // "example" app. If we use SharedPreferences in more than one of the apps
  // they would use the same storage container and share the settings when you
  // build them locally. By using Hive for most examples, we can change
  // the storage container name for each example. In these demos the
  // SharedPreferences service is only used for this example, but you can swap
  // in the Hive based one here as well if you want to try it.
  // This also demonstrates how swap used persistence implementation.
  final ThemeService themeService = ThemeServicePrefs();
  // To swap to Hive use this instead:
  // final ThemeService themeService = ThemeServiceHive('flex_scheme_box_3');
  // Initialize the theme service.
  await themeService.init();
  // Create a ThemeController that uses the ThemeService.
  final ThemeController themeController = ThemeController(themeService);
  // Load all the preferred theme settings, while the app is loading, before
  // MaterialApp is created. This prevents a sudden theme change when the app
  // is first displayed.
  await themeController.loadAll();
  // Run the app and pass in the ThemeController. The app listens to the
  // ThemeController for changes.
  runApp(DemoApp(themeController: themeController));
}
```

We set the surface mode to 
`FlexSurfaceMode.levelSurfacesLowScaffold` and `blendLevel` to 20. This
gives us the same medium blend level primary color alpha blend, on the 
theme colorscheme background and surface colors, while 
scaffold uses a much lower blend.

In dark mode we decided to use the inverted blend surface mode to this,
`highScaffoldLowSurfaces`, where surface and background colors have lower 
primary color alpha blend, in relation the Scaffold background color. We also
set the used blend level a btt lower, to 15 in dark mode.

 ```dart
 class DemoApp extends StatelessWidget {
  const DemoApp({Key? key, required this.themeController}) : super(key: key);
  final ThemeController themeController;

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return AnimatedBuilder(
      animation: themeController,
      builder: (BuildContext context, Widget? child) {
        return MaterialApp(
          debugShowCheckedModeBanner: false,
          scrollBehavior: AppScrollBehavior(),
          title: 'Four Themes',
          theme: FlexThemeData.light(
            colors: themeController.usedScheme == FlexScheme.custom
                    ? _myFlexScheme.light
                    : FlexColor.schemes[themeController.usedScheme]!.light,
            // We use a surface color mode where all Material surfaces use
            // the same primary color branding, but scaffold background
            // uses much less.
            surfaceMode: FlexSurfaceMode.levelSurfacesLowScaffold,
            // We set the blend level strength to 20.
            blendLevel: 20,
            appBarElevation: 0.5,
            useSubThemes: themeController.useSubThemes,
            visualDensity: FlexColorScheme.comfortablePlatformDensity,
            fontFamily: GoogleFonts.notoSans().fontFamily,
          ),
          // We do the exact same definition for the dark theme.
          darkTheme: FlexThemeData.dark(
            colors: themeController.usedScheme == FlexScheme.custom
                    ? _myFlexScheme.dark
                    : FlexColor.schemes[themeController.usedScheme]!.dark,
            // We don't have to use the same surface mode in dark mode, for an
            // interesting effect here we use a mode where scaffold background
            // color gets a much higher blend value than surface and background.
            surfaceMode: FlexSurfaceMode.highScaffoldLowSurfaces,
            // You don't have to use same blend level or mode in light
            // and dark mode, here we use a lower value in dark mode, that
            // goes better together with the highScaffoldLowSurfaces mode.
            blendLevel: 15,
            appBarElevation: 1,
            useSubThemes: themeController.useSubThemes,
            visualDensity: FlexColorScheme.comfortablePlatformDensity,
            fontFamily: GoogleFonts.notoSans().fontFamily,
          ),
          themeMode: themeController.themeMode,
          // This simple example app has only one page.
          home: HomePage(
            // Pass in the FlexSchemeData we use for the active theme.
            flexSchemeData: themeController.usedScheme == FlexScheme.custom
                    ? _myFlexScheme
                    : FlexColor.schemes[themeController.usedScheme]!,
            // Pass in the theme controller to the home page.
            controller: themeController,
          ),
        );
      },
    );
  }
}
 ```

We select used theme for the app by using the theme controller's 
`usedScheme` property, that contains the value of currently selected 
`FlexScheme` enum. If it is the `custom` value, we use our custom scheme 
`myFlexScheme` colors. If it is any other value, we get the corresponding 
colors from the `FlexColor.schemes` map, using the enum value as key.

On the `HomePage` we have a Flutter SDK `ToggleButtons` UI widget, that
allows us the select 4 different `FlexScheme` enum values, it changes the 
`themeController` accordingly. The used enum values we can use are
`hippieBlue`, `mallardGreen`, `outerSpace` and the `custom` option.

You can find the simple `ToggleButtons` based enum value selector
[here](https://github.com/rydmike/flex_color_scheme/blob/master/example/lib/shared/widgets/app/theme_select_buttons.dart).

The `themeController` is also used to decide if we opt in or out on using
the new sub theming via `useSubThemes`. A simple on/off switch on the `HomePage` 
allows us to toggle its state between true and false, thus turning on or off
the usage of FlexColorScheme's sub theming feature.

Below are the four resulting themes with their light and dark modes, that we 
can select and use in this example.

_Example 3) Using three built-in schemes, plus a custom color scheme
as application theme options. (click image to open hires version)_

Scroll down in the app to see the theme showcase further below. It presents the
theme with common Material UI widgets. You can try this example as a Flutter
[web app here](https://rydmike.com/flexcolorschemeV4Tut3).

## Example 4 - All Themes

This example shows how you can use all the built-in color schemes, plus three 
custom color schemes. How to select which one of these schemes is used to 
define the active theme. 

The example also uses primary color blending on background and 
surface colors. A subpage is available that shows the same theme applied when 
opening another page, that in Flutter just inherits the same theme.

> The full code is not shown below, only highlights.
> Please find the complete example code
> [here](https://github.com/rydmike/flex_color_scheme/tree/master/example/lib/example4).

The `main` start function of the app is very similar to example 3.
However, here we use the popular package [Hive](https://pub.dev/packages/hive) to 
persist settings and persist the theme settings with a `ThemeServiceHive` 
instead of using the `ThemeServicePrefs` service. 

> #### Why do we use Hive here and not SharedPreferences?
>
> The examples are all built using same "example" app. If we use
> SharedPreferences in more than one of the apps
> they would use the same storage container and share the settings when you
> build them locally. By using Hive for most examples, we can change
> the storage container name for each example. In these demos the
> SharedPreferences service is only used for example 3.

```dart
// The ThemeServiceHive constructor requires a box name, the others do not.
// The box name is just a file name for the file that stores the settings.
final ThemeService themeService = ThemeServiceHive('flex_scheme_box_4');
// Initialize the theme service.
await themeService.init();
// Create a ThemeController that uses the ThemeService.
final ThemeController themeController = ThemeController(themeService);
// Load all the preferred theme settings, while the app is loading, before
// MaterialApp is created. This prevents a sudden theme change when the app
// is first displayed.
await themeController.loadAll();
// Run the app and pass in the ThemeController. The app listens to the
// ThemeController for changes.
runApp(DemoApp(themeController: themeController));
```

Instead of having having our final and const color and scheme definitions 
values in the main file, we moved them into a static class called 
[AppColor](https://github.com/rydmike/flex_color_scheme/blob/master/example/lib/shared/const/app_color.dart).

There we begin by defining the same colors that we used in example 2 and 3, 
to be our first custom color. In this case we also assign a custom color 
to the optional `appBarColor`.

```dart
// Create a custom flex scheme color for a light theme.
static const FlexSchemeColor _myScheme1Light = FlexSchemeColor(
  primary: Color(0xFF00296B),
  primaryVariant: Color(0xFF2F5C91),
  secondary: Color(0xFFFF7B00),
  secondaryVariant: Color(0xFFFDB100),
  // The built in schemes use their secondary variant color as their
  // custom app bar color, but it can be any color. We use a custom color
  // here. We will see this in example 5 when using the theme and selecting
  // the custom app bar style.
  appBarColor: Color(0xFFf95738),
);
// Create a corresponding custom flex scheme color for a dark theme.
static const FlexSchemeColor _myScheme1Dark = FlexSchemeColor(
  primary: Color(0xFF6B8BC3),
  primaryVariant: Color(0xFF4874AA),
  secondary: Color(0xffff7155),
  secondaryVariant: Color(0xFFF1CB9D),
  appBarColor: Color(0xFF892807),
);
```

You can build a scheme the long way, by specifying all the required 
scheme colors, like above, or you can also build schemes from a
single primary color. With the `FlexSchemeColor.from` factory. When doing so
the only required color is the primary color, the other colors will be
computed. You can optionally also provide the `primaryVariant`, `secondary` and
`secondaryVariant` colors with the factory, but any color that is not provided
will always be computed to get all the required colors in `FlexSchemeColor`.

In this example we create our 2nd scheme from just a primary color for the 
light and dark schemes. The custom `appBarColor` does in this case also receive
the same color value as the one that is computed for `secondaryVariant`
color. This is its default with the `FlexSchemeColor.from` factory if the 
color is not specified.

```dart
 // Vivid green colors.
static final FlexSchemeColor _myScheme2Light =
FlexSchemeColor.from(primary: const Color(0xFF055C34));
static final FlexSchemeColor _myScheme2Dark =
FlexSchemeColor.from(primary: const Color(0xFF629F80));
```

For our 3rd custom color scheme we define primary and secondary colors, 
but no variant colors, we will not make any dark scheme definitions either, all
these missing colors will be computed. The missing color definitions will
get computed by the factory `FlexSchemeColor.from` when it creates the
`FlexSchemeColor` object. To make our dark colors for this light scheme, we
use the method `toDark` further below with the `_myScheme3Light` instance.


```dart
  // Blue and red colors, for a classic blue and red theme.
 final FlexSchemeColor myScheme3Light = FlexSchemeColor.from(
  primary: const Color(0xFF04368E),
  secondary: const Color(0xFFA00505),
 );
```

Next we create a list `AppData.schemes`, with all the color schemes we will use. 
Starting with our three custom color schemes. Normally when we make custom 
schemes, those are probably the ones we want to use primarily, so we put them 
first in our preferred order. After our custom schemes, we add all the 
pre-defined built-in ones, offering them as options users can switch to 
and use if they like.

> A **FlexSchemeData** object stores `name` and `description` plus the 
> matching `FlexSchemeColor` for `light` and `dark` mode color schemes. 

```dart
static final List<FlexSchemeData> schemes = <FlexSchemeData>[
  // We add our custom light and dark FlexSchemeColor schemes we defined
  // to a list of FlexSchemeData, where we can bundle each light and dark
  // theme that goes together and give it a name and description too.
  const FlexSchemeData(
    name: 'C1: Midnight',
    description: 'Midnight blue theme, created by using custom color values '
            'for all colors in the scheme',
    // FlexSchemeData holds separate defined color schemes for light and
    // matching dark theme colors. Dark theme colors typically need to be less
    // saturated versions of their than light counter parts. Using the same
    // colors in light and dark theme modes does not work so well.
    light: _myScheme1Light,
    dark: _myScheme1Dark,
  ),
  // Do the same for our second custom scheme.
  FlexSchemeData(
    name: 'C2: Greens',
    description: 'Vivid green theme, created from one primary color in light '
            'mode and another primary for dark mode',
    light: _myScheme2Light,
    dark: _myScheme2Dark,
  ),
  // We also do the same for our 3rd custom scheme, BUT we create its matching
  // dark colors, from the light FlexSchemeColor with the toDark method.
  FlexSchemeData(
    name: 'C3: Red & Blue',
    description: 'Classic read and blue, created from only light theme mode '
            'primary and secondary colors',
    light: _myScheme3Light,
    // We create the dark desaturated colors from the light scheme.
    dark: _myScheme3Light.toDark(),
  ),
  // Unpack all built-in FlexColor schemes using spread operator into our list.
  ...FlexColor.schemesList,
];
```

The setup of the `MaterialApp` is as simple as in the previous example and
almost identical, for demonstration purposes we use other values for
`surfaceMode` and its `blendLevel`. We also use values for the choice 
of `visualDensity` and `fontFamily` from a static `AppData` class.

```dart
class DemoApp extends StatelessWidget {
  const DemoApp({Key? key, required this.themeController}) : super(key: key);
  final ThemeController themeController;

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Whenever the user updates theme settings, the MaterialApp is rebuilt.
    return AnimatedBuilder(
      animation: themeController,
      builder: (BuildContext context, Widget? child) {
        return MaterialApp(
          debugShowCheckedModeBanner: false,
          scrollBehavior: AppScrollBehavior(),
          title: 'All Themes',
          // Define the light theme for the app, using current scheme index.
          theme: FlexThemeData.light(
            // We moved the definition of the list of color schemes to use into
            // a separate static class and list. We use the theme controller
            // to change the index of used color scheme from the list.
            colors: AppColor.schemes[themeController.schemeIndex].light,
            // Here we use another surface blend mode, where the scaffold
            // background gets a strong blend. This type is commonly used
            // on web/desktop when you wrap content on the scaffold in a
            // card that has a lighter background.
            surfaceMode: FlexSurfaceMode.highScaffoldLowSurfaces,
            // Our content is not all wrapped in cards in this demo, so
            // we keep the blend level fairly low for good contrast.
            blendLevel: 5,
            appBarElevation: 0.5,
            useSubThemes: themeController.useSubThemes,
            // In this example we use the values for visual density and font
            // from a single static source, so we can change it easily there.
            visualDensity: AppData.visualDensity,
            fontFamily: AppData.font,
          ),
          // We do the exact same definition for the dark theme, but using
          // FlexThemeData.dark() and the dark FlexSchemeColors in our
          // AppColor.schemes list instead.
          darkTheme: FlexThemeData.dark(
            colors: AppColor.schemes[themeController.schemeIndex].dark,
            surfaceMode: FlexSurfaceMode.highScaffoldLowSurfaces,
            // We go with a slightly stronger blend in dark mode. It is worth
            // noticing, that in light mode, the alpha value used for the blends
            // is the blend level value, but in dark mode it is 2x this value.
            // Visually they match fairly well, but it depends on how saturated
            // your dark mode primary color is.
            blendLevel: 7,
            appBarElevation: 0.5,
            useSubThemes: themeController.useSubThemes,
            visualDensity: AppData.visualDensity,
            fontFamily: AppData.font,
          ),
          // Use the dark or light theme based on controller setting.
          themeMode: themeController.themeMode,
          // Here we only pass the theme controller to the HomePage.
          home: HomePage(controller: themeController),
        );
      },
    );
  }
}
 ```

To select which of the 39 themes we use, becomes as simple as
giving the `themeController.schemeIndex` the index value of the color scheme
we want to use. We do that with a simple popup menu button on the `HomePage`.
This is a standard Flutter SDK UI widget, you can find how it is set up
for this use case
[here](https://github.com/rydmike/flex_color_scheme/blob/master/example/lib/example4/widgets/theme_popup_menu.dart).

In the app you can then use the popup menu available in the ListTile, showing the 
current theme to change the active theme. You can choose any of the built-in 36 
schemes, plus the three custom color schemes we added. 

When you change scheme, you will notice that the active theme color changes are 
animated by interpolating from the active theme colors, to the new theme colors.
This is a very nice standard feature when you modify the theme used by a Flutter
Material application.

When you build **Example 4**, it starts with the **Blue whale** theme.

[<img src="https://rydmike.com/assets_fcsv4/24-example-4-a-small.jpg?raw=true" alt="ColorScheme example 4 light" />](https://rydmike.com/assets_fcsv4/24-example-4-a.png?raw=true)
[<img src="https://rydmike.com/assets_fcsv4/24-example-4-b-small.jpg?raw=true" alt="ColorScheme example 4 dark" />](https://rydmike.com/assets_fcsv4/24-example-4-b.png?raw=true)   
_Example 4) Using custom schemes, plus all the built-in ones as application
theme options (click image to open hires version)_

Scroll down in the app to see the theme showcase further below. It presents the
theme with common Material UI widgets. You can try this example as a Flutter
[web app here](https://rydmike.com/flexcolorschemeV4Tut4).

## Example 5 - Themes Playground

This example shows how you can use all the built-in color schemes in 
FlexColorScheme to define themes from them. How you can set up your own 
custom scheme colors, and use them together with the predefined ones. Like the 
previous example, this can give you an idea of how you can create your own 
complete custom list of color schemes if you do not want to use the predefined 
ones.

This example also shows how you can use and vary the surface blend modes, change
the blend strength. You can see how the quick custom AppBar theme and its companion 
TabBar theme works. The usage of the true black feature for dark 
themes is also demonstrated. Using the optional Windows desktop like tooltip
theme is also shown.

The example includes a responsive side menu, it gives a visual 
presentation of what applications that have larger visible surfaces using 
surface blends look like. The menu has working click commands that allow you to
show and hide the contents of the cards holding settings and results. On 
smaller media this makes it quicker to find interesting parts. There is a choice
that allows you the reset the persisted settings back to their default values.
To make a light/dark mode quick toggle always accessible when you test options
and themes, it is also available on the side menu as a toggle.

In addition to allowing you to opt in and out of using the sub themes, this demo
also allows you to control many sub theming parameters, like adjusting the border
radius on all widgets to some other preferred value. To use the Material 3 (M3)
inspired text theme, different theme options on TextField, among many other 
sub theming features.

A subpage is also available that show that the same active theme is also 
applied when opening another page. This works because all built-in widgets use 
the same inherited theme and use the colors in the theme in predefined ways 
by default. This is a good example and explanation of why you should use 
the same theme colors for your custom re-usable widgets as their default color
property values. Then theme your application to make it look the way you want
it to look, rather than defining constant color values that you apply 
directly to widget color properties.

If you tried the previous examples on an Android device, you might have noticed 
that the system navigation bar on Android devices does not change. It is 
not themed to have matching background or theme mode that matches the active
application theme as it changes. This example shows how it can be fixed and 
that the used method remain in effect when opening a subpage.

The same custom color schemes as in example 4, are also used in this example. 
They are not explained here again, please
see [example 4](#example-4---all-themes) for details.

> The full code is not shown below, only highlights.
> Please find the complete example code
> [here](https://github.com/rydmike/flex_color_scheme/tree/master/example/lib/example5).

The `main` start function of the app is the same as in previous example.

```dart
Future<void> main() async {
  WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();
  // Use a ThemeController, which glues our theme settings to Flutter Widgets.
  //
  // The controller uses an abstract ThemeService interface to get and save the
  // settings. There are 3 implementations available to choose from:
  //
  // 0. ThemeService      - Abstract interface base class, contains defaults
  //                        values and shared storage key value strings.
  // 1. ThemeServiceMem   - Only keeps settings in memory.
  // 2. ThemeServicePrefs - Persist settings locally using SharedPreferences.
  // 3. ThemeServiceHive  - Persist settings locally using Hive.
  //
  // Here we use Hive. The examples are all built using same
  // "example" app. If we use SharedPreferences in more than one of the apps
  // they would use the same storage container and share the settings when you
  // build them locally. By using Hive for most examples, we can change
  // the storage container name for each example. In these demos the
  // SharedPreferences service is only used for example 3, but you can swap in
  // the Hive based one for it as well.

  // The ThemeServiceHive constructor requires a box name, the others do not.
  // The box name is just a file name for the file that stores the settings.
  final ThemeService themeService = ThemeServiceHive('flex_scheme_box_5');
  // Initialize the theme service.
  await themeService.init();
  // Create a ThemeController that uses the ThemeService.
  final ThemeController themeController = ThemeController(themeService);
  // Load all the preferred theme settings, while the app is loading, before
  // MaterialApp is created. This prevents a sudden theme change when the app
  // is first displayed.
  await themeController.loadAll();
  // Run the app and pass in the ThemeController. The app listens to the
  // ThemeController for changes.
  // The ThemeController controls all the myriad of Theme settings used
  // in the demo application and also persists settings with injected
  // ThemeService.
  runApp(DemoApp(themeController: themeController));
}
```

This example has a toggle that allows you to for all the schemes use `toDark`
computed dark schemes, instead of the hand tuned built-in ones. You can then
compare this result to hand-made dark themes. The `toDark` method does a 
pretty good job and can even be tuned with a level property. 

> If you use the `toDark` method on the last custom scheme, you will not see
any difference, because we already created its dark scheme in this 
example with this method. Turning the toggle on for it, computes the same dark
scheme from the same light scheme colors again. There is a slider that 
you can use to adjust the white blend level of the `toDark` method. 
From its default value of 35%, to be anything from 0...100 %, you can experiment 
with it and see what it does.

Additionally, this example includes a toggle that allows you to instead of 
using the `FlexColorScheme.toTheme` method, use the standard Flutter
`ThemeData.from` factory to create the theme from the same color scheme 
definition. We can use this toggle to see and study the differences 
that `FlexThemeData` brings to the standard theme with different settings.

The code for the `MaterialApp` for this complex looking application is actually
very similar and even identical regarding its core principle to example 4.
It is just a large number of `ThemeController` values that we assign
to properties in `FlexThemeData.light` and `FlexThemeData.dark`. Plus many more
UI widgets used to set new values to the controller. The `ThemeService`
persists all the values as we change them, same way as before too. The theme 
controller notifies its listeners about the change, still using the same setup 
as before in our `MaterialApp` since example 2. The app then just
rebuilds the UI to reflect our new theme settings.

It gets repetitive and rather long to show the details here. It is easier to 
read `main` and `MaterialApp` StatelessWidget code [here](https://github.com/rydmike/flex_color_scheme/blob/master/example/lib/example5/main.dart).
It is well commented and explains all its parts well. You can certainly
examine the `HomePage` too, I recommend doing that with an IDE though.
It is beyond the scope of this tutorial to explain all its details,
but mostly it is just simple UI layout code.

The concludes the walk through of example 5. When we build it, 
the example starts with the **blue whale** color scheme.

_Example 5) The Themes Playground (click image to open hires version)_

You can try the **FlexColorScheme Themes Playground** example as a Flutter
[web app here](https://rydmike.com/flexcolorschemeV4Tut5).

## Custom Themes and Automatic Flutter Source Code

After the first release of FlexColorScheme v4, example 5 was expanded with
two new major features. This did not require any changes to FlexColorScheme
itself, it was just useful new features in example 5 and the
published live version of it. The new features make the **Themes Playground**
a very useful companion app for FlexColorScheme. It is now possible to use it
to make custom theme setups with totally custom colors, and get the colors and 
theme you see, in use in your app with just a few clicks and a bit of 
code copy/paste action.

In the updated version of example 5, published as the 
[Themes Playground](https://rydmike.com/flexcolorschemeV4Tut5), these 
new features and tools are available:

**Custom Color Scheme**   
Copy an existing color scheme's colors to a custom scheme, that can then 
be modified by using a color picker. In this case by using 
[FlexColorPicker](https://pub.dev/packages/flex_color_picker). 
It has an interesting feature that names all colors, a practical copy/paste 
color values feature, and it also allows you to enter a color 
using its hex RGB color value.


**Get Setup Source Code**  
The Themes Playground can now also generate the code needed for you to 
make the same FlexColorScheme based theme you currently see, in your own app.

Using the **Get the code for this theme** feature, you can just copy and 
paste the current seen `FlexColorScheme` configuration from it, to your own
application. Then just use it without even knowing what all the properties do.
You can just go by what looks OK to you in the **Themes Playground**, copy
its setup code and use it as it is. All you have to do is copy the code and 
paste it into your app. 

You can find an example on how to do in this
[tweet and referenced thread](https://twitter.com/RydMike/status/1461381878494150659).

[<img src="https://rydmike.com/assets_fcsv4/09-ThemeMagic007.jpg?raw=true" alt="copy theme code" />](https://rydmike.com/assets_fcsv4/09-ThemeMagic007.png?raw=true)   
_Using Themes Playground to Copy Theme Setup Source Code (click image to open hires version)_

This is the first version of this code copy/paste feature to get the
configuration code for the shown FlexColorScheme based theme. A small bit 
of inception going on here, basically using FlexColorScheme to generate 
code for using FlexColorScheme. If you notice any issues with it, 
please open an issue in the repo.

# API Intro and Guide

The API documentation for FlexColorScheme is very thorough and complete. 
It usually covers any question you might have and more. Automatically 
generated API docs from source code document comments are available
[here](https://pub.dev/documentation/flex_color_scheme/latest/flex_color_scheme/flex_color_scheme-library.html). 

A brief overview of key APIs is presented below. This readme file is reaching
the character limit of 128kB, which is the maximum size pub.dev allows, if the
readme is larger it rejects the packages.

To make the documentation more accessible and easier to read, and to 
also make it possible to extend it further and update it without publishing
a new package version. There is a plan to migrate this readme file to use
a markup generated documentation site based on [docs.page](https://docs.page/homepage).
When that is done this chapter will be further extended.

## Main Setup

You can create FlexColorScheme based `ThemeData` objects using two 
different ways. Using the `FlexColorScheme` class or the `FlexThemeData` 
extension.

### FlexColorScheme

API reference: [FlexColorScheme](https://pub.dev/documentation/flex_color_scheme/latest/flex_color_scheme/FlexColorScheme-class.html)

The original way is to use the main 
[`FlexColorScheme`](https://pub.dev/documentation/flex_color_scheme/latest/flex_color_scheme/FlexColorScheme-class.html)
class and then use the `toTheme` getter to produce and get the `ThemeData` 
object specified by your immutable `FlexColorScheme` configuration.

Typically, you would not use the default `FlexColorScheme()` constructor to
make your setup. Instead, you would use
[`FlexColorScheme.light()`](https://pub.dev/documentation/flex_color_scheme/latest/flex_color_scheme/FlexColorScheme/FlexColorScheme.light.html) 
and
[`FlexColorScheme.dark()`](https://pub.dev/documentation/flex_color_scheme/latest/flex_color_scheme/FlexColorScheme/FlexColorScheme.dark.html) factory 
constructors to make definitions for light and dark theme modes. The
factory constructors also offer many more properties that give you
access to more nuanced color schemes definitions.

**Example:**
```dart
  class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
    @override
    Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Flutter Demo',
      // The Mandy red, light theme.
      theme: FlexColorScheme.light(scheme: FlexScheme.mandyRed).toTheme,
      // The Mandy red, dark theme.
      darkTheme: FlexColorScheme.dark(scheme: FlexScheme.mandyRed).toTheme,
      // Use dark or light theme based on system setting.
      themeMode: ThemeMode.system,
      home: MyHomePage(title: 'Flutter Demo Home Page'),
    );
```

### FlexThemeData extension on ThemeData

API reference: [FlexThemeData](https://pub.dev/documentation/flex_color_scheme/latest/flex_color_scheme/FlexThemeData.html)

The `FlexThemeData` is a convenience extension on `ThemeData` to define a 
`FlexColorScheme` object and return the `ThemeData` object defined by 
its instance, using its `FlexColorScheme.toTheme` method in one go.

Provided `ThemeData` convenience static extension functions are:

* [`FlexThemeData.light()`](https://pub.dev/documentation/flex_color_scheme/latest/flex_color_scheme/FlexThemeData/light.html) based on `FlexColorScheme.light().toTheme`
* [`FlexThemeData.dark()`](https://pub.dev/documentation/flex_color_scheme/latest/flex_color_scheme/FlexThemeData/dark.html) based on `FlexColorScheme.dark().toTheme`

Using e.g. `FlexThemeData.light()` is a bit shorter than 
`FlexColorScheme.light().toTheme`, and it may feel more familiar since
you get a `ThemeData` object directly that you can use just like any
other `ThemeData` object produced by Flutter SDK built in `ThemeData` factory
constructors.

**Example:**
```dart
  class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
    @override
    Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Flutter Demo',
      // The Mandy red, light theme.
      theme: FlexThemeData.light(scheme: FlexScheme.mandyRed),
      // The Mandy red, dark theme.
      darkTheme: FlexThemeData.dark(scheme: FlexScheme.mandyRed),
      // Use dark or light theme based on system setting.
      themeMode: ThemeMode.system,
      home: MyHomePage(title: 'Flutter Demo Home Page'),
    );
```

The `FlexColorScheme.light().toTheme` and `FlexThemedata.light()` and its dark 
counterparts, have the same parameter value and are interchangeable. 
The `light` and `dark` parameters differ slightly due to a few different features.

### Main setup parameters

Key setup parameters for `FlexColorScheme.light()` and 
`FlexThemedata.light()` as well as for `FlexColorScheme.dark()` and
`FlexThemedata.dark()` are listed below.

* `scheme` a [`FlexScheme`](https://pub.dev/documentation/flex_color_scheme/latest/flex_color_scheme/FlexScheme.html) 
  enum value used to select which predefined color scheme to use for the theme.
* `colors` a [`FlexSchemeColor`](https://pub.dev/documentation/flex_color_scheme/latest/flex_color_scheme/FlexSchemeColor-class.html)
  object used to define custom colors to be used to create the theme.

If you specify both `scheme` and `colors` the custom colors have higher precedence
and are used, the `scheme` property is ignored. If you specify neither, then
`scheme` defaults to `FlexScheme.material`.

* `appBarStyle`
  a [`FlexAppBarStyle`](https://pub.dev/documentation/flex_color_scheme/latest/flex_color_scheme/FlexAppBarStyle.html)
  enum value used to define the themed color of the AppBar background color.
* [`tabBarStyle`](https://pub.dev/documentation/flex_color_scheme/latest/flex_color_scheme/FlexColorScheme/tabBarStyle.html)
  a [`FlexTabBarStyle`](https://pub.dev/documentation/flex_color_scheme/latest/flex_color_scheme/FlexTabBarStyle.html)
  enum value used to select preferred style for the default TabBarTheme sub-theme.

An interesting and unique feature of FlexColorScheme is its capability to 
automatically create color schemes and resulting themes that blend in the primary
color of into different surfaces. And to vary this blending depending 
on surface type and use different blend strengths. This feature is offered
only via the factory constructors and their extension, not via the default
`FlexColorscheme` constructor.

* `surfaceMode` a [`FlexSurfaceMode`](https://pub.dev/documentation/flex_color_scheme/latest/flex_color_scheme/FlexSurfaceMode.html)
  enum value used to select the mode for blending in primary color into
  surface, background, scaffoldBackground and dialogBackground colors.
* `blendLevel` when `surfaceMode` is defined, this sets the blend level strength
   used by the selected surface mode.
   The blend level is the integer decimal value of the alpha value
   used in the alpha blend function. It mixes one color with another
   by using alpha opacity value in the color of a surface put on top of
   another surface with opaque color and returns the result as one opaque
   color.

FlexColorScheme also offers opinionated widget sub-theming that enables you to get 
more snazzy looking widgets automatically that you can customize further via 
[FlexSubThemesData](https://pub.dev/documentation/flex_color_scheme/latest/flex_color_scheme/FlexSubThemesData-class.html).

* [`useSubTheme`](https://pub.dev/documentation/flex_color_scheme/latest/flex_color_scheme/FlexColorScheme/useSubThemes.html)
  when `true` activates the opinionated sub theming, it is `false` by default.
* `subThemesData` is a 
  [`FlexSubThemesData`](https://pub.dev/documentation/flex_color_scheme/latest/flex_color_scheme/FlexSubThemesData-class.html)
  data class that contain many optional quick configuration parameters 
  for the opt-in widget sub-themes. For example, one of its parameters gives you 
  access to easy use customization of default corner radius on all Flutter SDK 
  UI widgets and elements that supports corner radius either via 
  ShapeBorder or BorderRadiusGeometry. See its 
  [`defaultRadius`](https://pub.dev/documentation/flex_color_scheme/latest/flex_color_scheme/FlexSubThemesData/defaultRadius.html)
  property for more information.

When you opt in on using sub-themes, the `FlexColorScheme.toTheme` method uses
the passed in `FlexSubThemesData` configuration data object, passed in via
`FlexColorScheme.subThemesData`, or a default one if one is not provided.

The property values in this `FlexSubThemesData` are used to define the created 
opinionated sub-themes. In some simple cases the sub-themes are created
directly with the Flutter SDK widget sub-theme in question, in the `toTheme` 
method. But in most cases it uses separate static sub-theme helper functions 
from the `FlexSubThemes` class. You can find more information about available 
helpers
[here](https://pub.dev/documentation/flex_color_scheme/latest/flex_color_scheme/FlexSubThemes-class.html).
You can also use these static sub-theme helpers to manually define widget 
sub-theme and even modify them using `copywith`.
