# This GitHub action runs on pull request to master, it:
#
#  - Installs dart and flutter
#  - Uses flutter stable channel. Might setup a matrix later with beta and dev included too.
#  - Enables flutter web
#  - Gets package dependencies
#  - Runs dart analyze, allows deprecation warnings, we on purpose allow use of deprecated features on dev channel,
#    as they might not yet be deprecated on stable and we will keep using some of the features that are deprecated
#    as long as they are not also deprecated on stable.
#  - Show outdated packages, just added for info.
#  - Verify that dart format is used by all committed code, fails if not. Controversial but pub.dev penalizes you if
#    dart format is not used.
#  - Run all tests with coverage.
#  - Upload code coverage output to Codecov for analysis.
#  - Install linux rpl tool. It is used to automate the needed change of a line in index.html.
#  - Build 5 different WEB example apps using FlexColorScheme. All examples use these steps:
#    - Flutter clean.
#    - Flutter build web app, in release mode and with CanvasKit renderer.
#    - Use rpl to fix/modify the index.html file to give it the correct href deployment sub-folder.
#  - This CI/CD stops here, it does not deploy, that is done by the deploy workflow, that is otherwise identical,
#    but runs on release, when it is published, created or edited.
#
#  TODO Maybe set this workflow up to also run on a weekly schedule to check that nothing is broken?
#       Also planning to setup a matrix test run, but this one is anyway a nice test
#       since it does not just runs tests, it also builds actual Web apps using the package.
