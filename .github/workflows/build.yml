# This GitHub action is only configured to run on demand by editing "on"
# condition as needed, set branch to "none" to never trigger it.
# This workflow:
#  - Installs dart and flutter
#  - Uses flutter stable channel.
#    Consider setting up a matrix later with beta and dev included too.
#  - Enables flutter web
#  - Gets package dependencies
#  - Runs dart analyze.
#  - Show outdated packages, just added for info.
#  - Verify that dart format is used by all committed code, fails if not.
#    Controversial but pub.dev penalizes you if dart format is not used.
#  - Run all tests with coverage.
#  - Upload code coverage output to Codecov for analysis.
#  - Install linux rpl tool, used to automate change of a line in index.html.
#  - Build 5 different WEB example apps using FlexColorScheme.
#    All examples use these steps:
#    - Flutter clean.
#    - Flutter build web app, in release mode and with CanvasKit renderer.
#    - Use rpl to fix/modify the index.html file to give it the correct
#      href deployment sub-folder.
#  - This CI/CD stops here, it does not deploy, that is done by the "deploy"
#    workflow, that is otherwise identical, that runs published.
