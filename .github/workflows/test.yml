# This GitHub action runs on push to master, it:
#
#  - Installs dart and flutter
#  - Uses flutter stable channel. Might setup a matrix later with beta and dev included too.
#  - Gets package dependencies
#  - Runs dart analyze, allows deprecation warnings, we on purpose allow use of deprecated features for now.
#  - Show outdated packages, just added for info.
#  - Verify that dart format is used by all committed code, fails if not. Controversial but pub.dev penalizes you if
#    dart format is not used.
#  - Run all tests with coverage.
#  - Upload code coverage output to Codecov for analysis.
