# This GitHub action is configured to run "on" push to "master".
# Currently, using the "validate" workflow instead, this is an older test CI/CD.
# This workflow:
#  - Installs dart and flutter
#  - Uses flutter stable channel.
#    Consider setting up a matrix later with beta and dev included too.
#  - Enables flutter web
#  - Gets package dependencies
#  - Runs dart analyze.
#  - Show outdated packages, just added for info.
#  - Verify that dart format is used by all committed code, fails if not.
#    Controversial but pub.dev penalizes you if dart format is not used.
#  - Run all tests with coverage.
#  - Upload code coverage output to Codecov for analysis.
