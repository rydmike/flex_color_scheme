    # Using redundant (default) argument values can be useful for in code documentation
    # purposes and also handy as a template when trying different settings in Flutter. It is often
    # quicker when dealing with not well known APIs to see parameter values in the call/constructor,
    # instead of using the IDE to peek into its default to figure out what the defaults are,
    # occasionally leaving a few redundant default valued parameters in the code is not that bad
    # when you are developing something new. For public packages you probably want to keep this
    # rule enabled.

    # Using this rule will sometimes force a line of 81 characters to be split in two.
    # As long as we try to respect that 80 characters limit, going slightly above is fine.
    # For packages keep this rule enabled though, because the pub.dev dart format check will
    # penalize packages points if it does not adhere to strict dart format rules, which apparently
    # requires max 80 char lines. This rule will then help you find cases where you go over
    # and fix them manually when possible.
    # I usually disable this rule if this is not a package.
