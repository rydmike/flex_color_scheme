// EXAMPLE 4 - All Themes
//
// This example shows how to use all the built in color schemes in
// FlexColorScheme to define themes from them and how to define your own
// custom scheme colors and use them together with the predefined ones.
//
// We now moved the color definitions to a separate color class called AppColor,
// in its own file '/const/app_color.dart'. It includes the color definitions
// we made in example 3, and adds two more custom schemes.
//
// The 2nd scheme is created by just defining primary color for dark and light
// scheme. The 3rd one we create by computing it from the light theme.
// Primary color alpha blended background and surface colors is used.
//
// The color value definition and list of all built in FlexSchemeData plus our
// custom definitions, are tucked into static list called schemes in AppColor.
//
// The Google font Noto Sans is used to show how to use custom fonts.
//
// A theme showcase widget shows the theme with several common Material widgets.
//
// A ThemeService and ThemeController is used to manage our
// theme settings. This follows the example architecture you get when you
// create a Flutter template application architecture with:
//
// flutter create -t skeleton my_flutter_app
//
// The theme controller is used to change the theme mode, to toggle
// opting in and out of FlexColorScheme's opinionated sub-themes, and to
// change the index value of the used colors from the list of FlexSchemeData
// in AppColor.schemes.
//
// You can try this app as a web app at:
// https://rydmike.com/flexcolorscheme/allthemes-v5
// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Future<void> main() async {
  WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();
  // Use a ThemeController, which glues our theme settings to Flutter Widgets.
  //
  // The controller uses an abstract ThemeService interface to get and save the
  // settings. There are 3 implementations available to choose from:
  //
  // 0. ThemeService      - Abstract interface base class.
  // 1. ThemeServiceMem   - Only keeps settings in memory.
  // 2. ThemeServicePrefs - Persist settings locally using SharedPreferences.
  // 3. ThemeServiceHive  - Persist settings locally using Hive.
  //
  // Here we use Hive. The examples are all built using same
  // "example" app. If we use SharedPreferences in more than one of the apps
  // they would use the same storage container and share the settings when you
  // build them locally. By using Hive for most examples, we can change
  // the storage container name for each example. In these demos the
  // SharedPreferences service is only used for example 3, but you can swap in
  // the Hive based one for it as well.

  // The ThemeServiceHive constructor requires a box name, the others do not.
  // The box name is just a file name for the file that stores the settings.
  final ThemeService themeService =
      ThemeServiceHive('flex_color_scheme_v5_box_4');
  // Initialize the theme service.
  await themeService.init();
  // Create a ThemeController that uses the ThemeService.
  final ThemeController themeController = ThemeController(themeService);
  // Load all the preferred theme settings, while the app is loading, before
  // MaterialApp is created. This prevents a sudden theme change when the app
  // is first displayed.
  await themeController.loadAll();
  // Run the app and pass in the ThemeController. The app listens to the
  // ThemeController for changes.
  runApp(DemoApp(themeController: themeController));
