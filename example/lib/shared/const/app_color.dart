  // computed. We can optionally also provide the `primaryContainer`,
  // `secondary` and `secondaryContainer` colors with the factory, but any
  // color that is not provided will always be computed to get all the required
  // colors in a `FlexSchemeColor`.

  // In this example we create our 2nd scheme from just a primary color for the

  // same as before version 5, but with two more colors. Its produced colors
  // fit better for M2 specification, they do also work in M3, they just don't
  // follow the guidelines with respect to the hue of the main color and its
