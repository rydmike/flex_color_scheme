/// A theme following wrapper for [SwitchListTileAdaptive].
///
/// The wrapper sets the active thumb color for the switch to
/// SwitchTheme.active color, and if not define to theme.colorscheme.secondary.
///
/// NOTE: toggleableActiveColor will be deprecated soon in Flutter SDK,
/// so we are using its replacement fallback already now. See:
/// https://docs.flutter.dev/release/breaking-changes/toggleable-active-color
///
/// The theme sets this color too, and that is fine for the Material mode.
/// However, if we want the color to also have an effect on the switch
/// when it is in its Cupertino mode, we actually have to set the [activeColor]
/// the the same color for the switch thumb. The Cupertino thumb switch button
/// cannot be changed via Material dependent theme. It cannot even be changed
/// with a Cupertino theme in a Cupertino app. It is so by design, since Apple
/// wants it to always be bright green when it is on.
///
/// In this app we want it to follow the selected theme color for consistency,
/// so we wrap the widget in a simple wrapper that sets the color to its
/// themed color, then it works and we get the themed color also in its
/// adaptive Cupertino mode.
///
/// This wrapper only wraps most common properties that we needed for the
/// SwitchListTileAdaptive in this application. Easy to add more when needed.
