// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
// EXAMPLE 5 - Themes Playground
//
// This example shows how you can use all the built in color schemes in
// FlexColorScheme to define themes from them and how you can define your own
// custom scheme colors and use them together with the predefined ones.
//
// The example also shows how you can use the surface branding feature and
// how to use the custom app bar theme features of FlexColorScheme. The usage
// of the true black theme feature for dark themes is also demonstrated.
// Using the optional Windows desktop like tooltip theme is also shown.
//
// A toggle that allows us to compare the result of custom defined dark schemes
// its computed versions is also available. To further demonstrate the
// difference between FlexThemeData and just Flutter SDK ThemeData.from, a
// toggle to try both is available for comparison purposes.
//
// The example includes a dummy responsive side menu and rail to give a visual
// presentation of what applications that have larger visible surfaces using
// the surface branding looks like.
//
// The color value definition and list of FlexSchemeData is tucked into
// a static class as AppColor.schemesCustom.
//
// The Google font NotoSans is used to show how to use custom fonts.
//
// A ThemeService and ThemeController is used to manage the theme settings.
// This follows the example architecture you get when you
// create a Flutter template application architecture with:
//
// flutter create -t skeleton my_flutter_app
//
// The theme controller is used to change the theme mode, to toggle
// opting in and out of FlexColorScheme's opinionated sub-themes, and to
// change the index value of the used colors from the list of FlexSchemeData
// in AppColor.schemesCustom and many other options.
//
// You can try this app as a web app at:
// https://rydmike.com/flexcolorscheme/themesplayground-v5

Future<void> main() async {
  WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();
  // Use a ThemeController, which glues our theme settings to Flutter Widgets.
  // The controller uses an abstract ThemeService interface to get and save the
  // settings. There are 3 implementations available to choose from:
  //
  // 0. ThemeService      - Abstract interface base class.
  // 1. ThemeServiceMem   - Only keeps settings in memory.
  // 2. ThemeServicePrefs - Persist settings locally using SharedPreferences.
  // 3. ThemeServiceHive  - Persist settings locally using Hive.
  //
  // Here we use Hive. The examples are all built using same
  // "example" app. If we use SharedPreferences in more than one of the apps
  // they would use the same storage container and share the settings when you
  // build them locally. By using Hive for most examples, we can change
  // the storage container name for each example. In these demos the
  // SharedPreferences service is only used for example 3, but you can swap in
  // the Hive based one for it as well.

  // The ThemeServiceHive constructor requires a box name, the others do not.
  // The box name is just a file name for the file that stores the settings.
  final ThemeService themeService =
      ThemeServiceHive('flex_color_scheme_v5_box_5');
  // Initialize the theme service.
  await themeService.init();
  // Create a ThemeController that uses the ThemeService.
  final ThemeController themeController = ThemeController(themeService);
  // Load preferred theme settings, while the app is loading, before MaterialApp
  // is created, this prevents a theme change when the app is first displayed.
  await themeController.loadAll();
  // Run the app and pass in the ThemeController. The app listens to the
  // ThemeController for changes. The same ThemeController as used in example 4
  // controls all the myriad of Theme settings and the ThemeService also
  // persists the settings with the injected ThemeServiceHive.
  runApp(DemoApp(controller: themeController));
