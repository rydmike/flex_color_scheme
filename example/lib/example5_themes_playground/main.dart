/// FlexColorScheme EXAMPLE 5 - Themes Playground
///
/// The learn more about using this app see the docs at:
/// - https://docs.flexcolorscheme.com/playground
///
/// The learn more about its history and design see docs at:
/// - https://docs.flexcolorscheme.com/tutorial5
///
/// A ThemeService and ThemeController is used to manage the theme settings.
/// This follows the example architecture you get when you
/// create a Flutter template application architecture with:
///
/// flutter create -t skeleton my_flutter_app
///
/// The theme controller is used to change the theme mode, to toggle
/// opting in and out of FlexColorScheme's opinionated sub-themes, and to
/// change the index value of the used colors from the list of FlexSchemeData
/// in AppColor.schemesCustom and many other options.
///
/// You can try this app as a web app at:
/// https://rydmike.com/flexcolorscheme/themesplayground-v7-1

  // Use a ThemeController, which glues our theme settings to Flutter Widgets.
  // The controller uses an abstract ThemeService interface to get and save the
  // settings. There are 3 implementations available to choose from:
  //
  // 0. ThemeService      - Abstract interface base class.
  // 1. ThemeServiceMem   - Only keeps settings in memory.
  // 2. ThemeServicePrefs - Persist settings locally using SharedPreferences.
  // 3. ThemeServiceHive  - Persist settings locally using Hive.
  //
  // Here we use Hive. The examples are all built using same
  // "example" app. If we use SharedPreferences in more than one of the apps
  // they would use the same storage container and share the settings when you
  // build them locally. By using Hive for most examples, we can change
  // the storage container name for each example. In these demos the
  // SharedPreferences service is only used for example 3, but you can swap in
  // the Hive based one for it as well.
  //
  // The ThemeServiceHive constructor requires a box name, the others do not.
  // The box name is just a file name for the file that stores the settings.
  final ThemeService themeService =
      ThemeServiceHive('flex_color_scheme_v5_box_5');
  // Initialize the theme service.
  await themeService.init();
  // Create a ThemeController that uses the ThemeService.
  final ThemeController themeController = ThemeController(themeService);
  // Load preferred theme settings, while the app is loading, before MaterialApp
  // is created, this prevents a theme change when the app is first displayed.
  await themeController.loadAll();

  // Only use Google fonts via asset provided fonts.

  // ThemeController for changes. The same ThemeController as used in example 4
