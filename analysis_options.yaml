    #
    # Treat assigning new values to a parameter as a warning. We would almost like to set this
    # to an error. However, this warning rule or even more so if set to an error, can sometimes
    # be a bit problematic you include other code directly that does it a lot.
    # It does however, make code safer when this cannot be done without involving
    # an extra local variable for clarity and safety. Enabling this error, even as just a warning,
    # does get in the way a bit if all you want to do is a null to default value release runtime
    # safety/fallback assignment. For that use case you have to add a local rule override. With
    # null-safety, the need for this kind of null check and re-assignment to default if null,
    # pretty much goes away. Considering the comment in:
    # https://dart-lang.github.io/linter/lints/parameter_assignments.html:
    # "Assigning new values to parameters is generally a bad practice unless an operator
    # such as ??= is used. Otherwise, arbitrarily reassigning parameters is usually a mistake."
    # One might even think the rule would allow using the ??= operator, but it does not. For now,
    # we keep this lint as warning and overriding locally with:
    #
    # When we need it for the ??= operator, or some copy/paste in of some code that does things
    # that needs it too, and that we don't want to deal with fixing at the moment.

    #
    # https://dart-lang.github.io/linter/lints/always_specify_types.html
    #
    # Avoid var when specifying that a type is unknown and short-hands that elude type annotations. Use
    # dynamic if you are being explicit that the type is unknown. Use Object if you are being explicit
    # that you want an object that implements == and hashCode.
    # The linter rule link above states this rule is from the Flutter style guide.
    #
    # This makes most code intent very explicit, sometimes this may help you
    # reason about unfamiliar libs, but it might get tedious when dealing with very familiar ones.
    # For people used to more relaxed or no type declaration, it is probably the other way around.
    # This rule is of course also in conflict with some other lint rules, most notably it
    # violates Effective Dart "AVOID type annotating initialized local variables".
    # https://dart-lang.github.io/linter/lints/omit_local_variable_types.html
    # Which we find to be a strange rule, the package lint agrees, with the statement that
    # "Types for local variables may improve readability" and keeps that avoid rule disabled.
    #
    # Turning always_specify_types lint rule on in a project at later stage is very tedious, fixing
    # all the analyzer warnings will take quite some time. Having it on as you write new code
    # is not so bad though, the IDE will handle it most of the time.
    # Most people probably want this lint rule OFF, but for now we try to keep it on
    # in our projects. We might reconsider this choice later, for example this issue has requested
    # a new softer related lint rule that could be used only for declarations:
    # https://github.com/dart-lang/linter/issues/1620
    # If such a lint rule materializes, we might switch to using it instead and turning this one off.
    #
    # We felt the above long explanation was warranted as a reminder. Keeping the rule listed here

    # ALWAYS use package imports for files in lib/.
    #
    # https://dart-lang.github.io/linter/lints/always_use_package_imports.html
    #
    # This rule conflicts with `prefer_relative_imports` so we turn it OFF.
    # We are still conflicted about which version to use, keeping it this way for now, as support
    # for relative imports have improved in both IDE's, but adding imports still often get imported as
    # package imports, and then you have to edit them manually. The IDEs can help with fixing them.
    # The relative paths can be a bit messy to keep track off, package imports are actually
    # a bit easier from that point of view.
    # Flutter repo now also prefers relative imports over packages imports, so that is
    # another reason to use that.
    #
    # Use what you prefer, but you have to be consistent though, since mixing and matching can
    # cause issues as the same file imported with the different options are considered to be
    # different libs and code, even if it is the same file. This may impact functionality
    # of e.g. singletons, service locators and increase code size.
    #
    # When you refactor and move folders with a lot of code in them, that other code depends
    # on for imports via relative imports, then they get messed up by Flutter IDEs
    # VS-Code and AS/IntelliJ. Both main Flutter IDEs may fail to correctly refactor moved folders
    # and imports that depend on files in the moved folders.

    # AVOID defining a class that contains only static members.
    #
    # https://dart-lang.github.io/linter/lints/avoid_classes_with_only_static_members.html
    #
    # Creating classes with the sole purpose of providing utility or otherwise static methods is discouraged
    # in effective Dart. Dart allows functions to exist outside of classes for this very reason.
    # Effective Dart says avoid classes with only static members:
    # https://dart.dev/guides/language/effective-dart/design#avoid-defining-a-class-that-contains-only-static-members
    # However, the Flutter style guide says use them when it makes sense:
    # https://github.com/flutter/flutter/wiki/Style-guide-for-Flutter-repo#begin-global-constant-names-with-prefix-k
    # Colors is an example of such a class, but they still enable this rule in the repo though, go figure.
    #
    # Like Pedantic, we like util and static classes too, so we use them.
    # We tried the Effective Dart style and used a of kConstants in different const files. This
    # is more cumbersome to use than static classes. The import is simpler with static classes and
    # the code looks cleaner. If you use a lot of constant files, importing them is more tedious,
    # and you cannot enforce a given 'as' name to have a consistent name space prefix. A static
    # class gives you that automatically, thus providing context for the constants and static functions.

    # Positional boolean parameters are considered a bad practice because they are very ambiguous.
    # Using named boolean parameters is much more readable because it inherently describes
    # what the boolean value represents.
    # In principle, we agree with the argument against positional booleans. However, positional booleans
    # are OK when they are the ONLY boolean parameter in a callback, and also very handy when used in a
    # model setter from the callback directly.
    #
    # Flutter API contains many callbacks with the signature: {void Function(bool) onChanged} often
    # for UI toggle switches. To keep things tidy and clean with a model setter for such a callback,
    # a setter method with a positional boolean is needed, a typical pattern is:
    # Switch.adaptive(
    #   value: model.hideTooltips,
    #   onChanged: model.setHideTooltips,
    # ),
    #
    # We are turning OFF this AVOID rule. Willing to reconsider if I get convinced there are better ways,

    # PREFER asserts with a message string.
    #
    # https://dart-lang.github.io/linter/lints/prefer_asserts_with_message.html
    #
    # When assertions fail it's not always simple to understand why. Adding a message to the
    # assert function helps the developer to understand why the AssertionError occurs.
    #
    # While this is true, Dart does nowadays create very clear messages from assert terms by default.
    # Flutter SDK does not use this rule or style. When you use code from it for customized
    # widgets you will end up having to write your own messages for the code snippet.
    #
    # Rationale for not using this in Flutter SDK:
    # "Assertions blocks don't require a message because they throw simple to understand errors"
    #
    # We agree, so we do not mind turning OFF this rule when it becomes tedious, but we start
    # with it ON. With NNBD you also usually a lot less asserts than you did before in Dart code,
    # since NNBD made almost all "not null" assertions unnecessary.

    # Dart has named constructors. Static methods in other languages (java) are a workaround which don't have
    # named constructors. We don't mind this lint rule, it is OK, BUT we noticed that
    # if you want/need to create instances of classes via static helpers in another class, that
    # this lint rules complains about it. We are OK with preferring a named
    # constructor over a static method to create an instance from within the same class.
    # But this lint rule complained about the above usage too where we think it makes sense to use this.
    # This rule currently complains about use cases that in some scenarios is impossible to comply with.
    # Maybe this is another issue with this lint rule. We should investigate it further and report
    # it, if it is. For now we disable this rule.

    # DO sort constructor declarations before other members.
    #
    # We do like this lint rule, but we want to have the default constructor first, followed
    # by its properties, after this other named constructors and factories. This rule gets
    # in the way of that and forces you to put (often final) constructor properties after all
    # the named constructors and factories, making them tedious to find and disconnected from
    # where we want to see, read and handily edit them. This is especially the case if there are
    # many constructors and factories, and they have a lot of parameters. For now, we disable
    # this rule and order things as described above, which apart from the default constructor
    # properties coming right after the constructor, is the only part where we in practice
    # deviate from this rule, so other yes, we do put constructors first as well anyway.

    # Incompatible with `prefer_final_locals` that we want because having immutable local variables when
    # applicable makes larger functions more predictable and easier to reason about, so we
    # use `prefer_final_locals` instead.
